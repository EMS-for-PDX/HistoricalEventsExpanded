## Characters for the Eastern Romans - 867 ##
# Utilizes Christian Settipani's works "Continuité des élites à Byzance durant les siècles obscurs" and "Continuité gentilice et continuité familiale dans les familles sénatoriales romaines à l'époque impériale: mythe et réalité" #
# The aforementioned works are in great part speculation, which is something to consider, but the narrative posed by Settipani can be intriguing to consider. So while the more improbable ideas will be discounted, ideas that can not be strictly discounted may be implimented in lieu of a lack of other sources #
