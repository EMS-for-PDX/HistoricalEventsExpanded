 bm_867_hee_byzantines_desc: "The old powers of Iberia are breaking.\n\nIn the north, Asturias is rife with ambitious vassals, straining to be free.\n\nIn the south, al-Andalus waxes strong but faces rumblings of discontent. The border military districts mutter about independence and intrigue plagues the ruling Umayyads.\n\nHungry foreign powers eye Iberia's rich lands covetously.\n\n#bold Centuries in the making, the $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ enters a new phase, and whether it ends in blood or brotherhood lies on a roll of the dice."

 bookmark_hee_byzantine_michael_iii_desc: "Having been crowned as Emperor of the Romans when he was just two, Michael III relative youth betrays the impact of his reign.\n\nOver the last 25 years following the end of Iconoclasm, the economy has been stabilized, a renaissance in visual arts has emerged, considerable advances were made in internal organisation and religious cohesion, and the Empire has more than held its own against the Abbasid Caliphate. Most importantly Bulgaria had been transformed into a religious and cultural satellite of Byzantium.\n\n#bold However within the year, Michael will be dead. Betrayed by those he trusted, Michael will be dismissed as a drunkard and a fool by those who usurp him. Can you guide Michael to avoid his fate and lead the Empire into a Renaissance whose foundation he has helped create?#!"

 # Niketas Ooryphas Loc
 bookmark_hee_byzantine_niketas_ooryphas: "Doux Niketas"
 bookmark_hee_byzantine_niketas_ooryphas_desc: "Niketas Ooryphas first appears in the historical record around 860, as urban prefect of Constantinople, when a Rus' fleet suddenly appeared in the entrance to the Bosporus and started pillaging the city's suburbs. In his capacity as urban prefect, Ooryphas made a report to Emperor Michael III, who was campaigning against the Arabs in Asia Minor.\n\nLikely being recognized for his talent, Niketas was appointed to a position in the Byzantine navy, and by 867 he had risen to the rank of #italic droungarios tou ploïmou#! - commander of the Imperial Fleet. As such he sailed with 100 ships in relief of Ragusa against an Arab siege which had already lasted 15 months, and restored imperial suzerainty over the coasts of Dalmatia.\n\n#bold Going on to win several battles against Saracen fleets, Niketas would become known as perhaps the most successful Byzantine admiral of his age. Can you weather the storm and forge a new destiny of your making?"

 # Chrysocheir Loc

 bookmark_hee_byzantine_chrysocheir_desc: "During the first decades of the 9th century, the Paulicians were well established as a numerous and warlike community across Asia Minor, but were seen as heretics by the Byzantine state and consequently suffered on-and-off persecution. Not ones to tolerate such treatment, they staged a number of revolts from their various strongholds throughout Asia Minor. As a result, the Byzantine empress-regent Theodora launched an empire-wide pogrom against the Paulicians in 843, where allegedly up to 100,000 Paulicians perished.\n\nAmong the victims was Chrysocheir' grandfather, who was impaled after refusing to renounce his faith. Under the guidance of Chrysocheir's uncle Karbeas, many Paulicians fled to the Muslim border emirates and established an independent principality centred on Tephrike.\n\n#bold Having succeeded Karbeas after his death in 863, the responsibility of leadership falls on you. Can you ensure the survival of your people?"

 # Phokas Loc
 bookmark_hee_byzantine_leon_phokas: "Count Leon"
 bookmark_hee_byzantine_leon_phokas_desc: "The Phokas were a Byzantine aristocratic clan from Cappadocia, which in the 9th and 10th centuries provided a series of high-ranking generals and an emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas. Its members and their clients monopolized the high-command positions of the Byzantine army for much of the 10th century and led the successful Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in the East.\n\nAs one of the leading families of the Anatolian military aristocracy, the Phokades were also involved in a series of rebellions that laid claim to power and challenged the emperors at Constantinople. Their power was eventually broken by Emperor Basil II, and the family declined in importance after the 11th century.\n\n#bold However Leon is but a soldier of humble origins. Can you achieve the historical greatness of this dynasty, and perhaps avoid its fall in the process? The destiny of this great house rests with you."
