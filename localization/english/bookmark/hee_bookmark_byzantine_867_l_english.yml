 bm_867_hee_byzantines_desc: "The old powers of Iberia are breaking.\n\nIn the north, Asturias is rife with ambitious vassals, straining to be free.\n\nIn the south, al-Andalus waxes strong but faces rumblings of discontent. The border military districts mutter about independence and intrigue plagues the ruling Umayyads.\n\nHungry foreign powers eye Iberia's rich lands covetously.\n\n#bold Centuries in the making, the $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ enters a new phase, and whether it ends in blood or brotherhood lies on a roll of the dice."

Reappointed to his father's lands, $GuifrE_$'s scheming cousin has likewise taken back his birthright, and their new liege is a cousin of the man who killed their parents.\n\n#bold You of all people know that fortunes can change in the blink of an eye, and crave a more secure prize — $d_barcelona$.#!"
