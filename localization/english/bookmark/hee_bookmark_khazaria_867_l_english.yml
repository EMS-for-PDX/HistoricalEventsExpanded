 bm_867_hee_khazaria: "Pax Khazaria"
 bm_867_hee_khazaria_desc: "The Qağanate of the Khazars took shape out of the ruins of the Göktürk Khaganate as it broke up under pressure from the Tang dynasty armies to the east sometime in the mid 7th Century - becoming the westernmost successor state of the formidable nomadic empire following its disintegration. And for over a century, it has been the Khazar Khaganate that has dominated the Pontic steppe and the Caucasus Mountains, controlling vital trans-Eurasian trade routes that has facilitated travel and trade between Europe and Asia by permitting Western Eurasian merchants safe transit across it to pursue their business without interference.\n\n#bold But now, the long peace of the Khazars is threatened. Caught in a pincer movement between upstart steppe tribes and an emergent Rus' power to the north, Khazaria stands at the precipice of total collapse. Can you restore, or bring down, the Pax Khazaria?"

 bookmark_hee_khazaria_manasseh_ii_desc: "Faced with pressure from the Byzantines and the Abbasids to convert to their respective religions, the Khazar elite chose to stay neutral and convert to Judaism. The Khagan of Khazaria starts off in a precarious position, facing a very serious independence revolt from his many Russian vassals to the west and the fellow nomads who haven’t converted to Judaism yet.\n\n#bold Can you keep this tribal melting pot of different cultures and religions together and perhaps one day even turn your gaze beyond your borders - and retake the holy lands from the interlopers?"

 # Askold and Dyre Loc
 bookmark_hee_khazaria_dyre_the_stranger: "Dyre "the Stranger""
 bookmark_hee_khazaria_dyre_the_stranger_desc: "Former comrades of the Varangian chieftain Rurik, Höskuldr and Dyre were sanctioned by Rurik to go to the great city of Constantinople. However on their way south, when travelling on the Dnieper, they came upon the city of Kiev and settled there - establishing their dominion over the Polyanians who had been paying tribute to the Khazars. After some time, the brothers would continue to Constantinople, but alongside a navy to pillage the city, catching the Byzantines by surprise and ravaging the suburbs of Constantinople not even a decade ago.\n\nPerhaps due to the splendor and wealth witnessed by the two in Miklagård, or recognition of the shifting tides after the Bulgarians turned to Christ, the brothers now welcome Christianity into their realm.\n\n#bold And Brothers will need God's help (or perhaps just yours) to outwit their many foes, but should they survive, the vast lands of Russia and Khazaria lie open."

 bookmark_hee_khazaria_zachariah_desc: "The Ashina Clan rose to prominence after revolting against the Rouran Khaganate and establishing the First Turkic Khaganate. And though the centuries have not been kind, your family falling to division and civil war, your blood remains strong.\n\n#bold Despite your clan being reduced to near extinction, while struggling to find your place in a perpetually shifting environment, perhaps you can lead your family once more to glory."

 # Dulo Dynasty Loc

 bookmark_hee_khazaria_shilki_desc: "When Old Great Bulgaria disintegrated following the death of Khan Kubrat and the subjugation of Kubrat's eldest son and heir Batbayan by Khazaria, Kubrat's other sons disregarded their father's advice to stay together in order to resist the enemies and soon departed, taking their own tribes with them. Kotrag, second son of Kubrat and leader of the Kutrigurs, led his tribe into the upper Volga-Ural region. There they established Volga Bulgaria, at the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers.\n\n#bold Though you have long been forced to bend the knee to the Khazars, their power has weakened. Now if one could unite the disparate tribes of the Bolghars, perhaps the dreams of a revived Bolghar state may be realized..."

 bookmark_hee_khazaria_pechenegs_desc: "When the Second Turkic Khaganate, also known as the Göktürks Khaganate, collapsed in 744, a series of intertribal confrontations was unleashed onto the Eurasian steppes. Among these conflicts was the struggle between the Oghuz Turks and the Pechenegs, one that ended when the Oghuz made an alliance with the Karluks and Kimaks that lead to a crushing defeat for the Pechenegs and their allies in a battle near the Lake Aral just two decades ago. Forced west, the Pechenegs once again find themselves under threat - though this time by the Khazars and their allies.\n\n#bold While some amongst the Penchenegs bend the knee to the Khaganate, others see opportunity. Among them is Yavdi, who gathers like-minded tribesmen who recognize that their future may lie even further west..."
