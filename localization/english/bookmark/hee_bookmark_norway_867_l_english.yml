 bm_867_hee_norway_desc: "The Roman Empire is a shell of its former self.\n\nThree centuries earlier, the grand ambitions of Emperor Justinian had created a Mediterranean juggernaut worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as the Empires of Augustus and and Trajan. But now, little of Justinian's legacy remains.\n\nBellicose Lombards pushed the Empire to the very fringes of Italy, constant migrations of Slavs and Bulgars along the Danube chipped away at the Empire's Balkan territories, all while the rise of a natal Islamic state permenantly deprived the Romans of Syria, Egypt, North Africa.\n\n#bold The Roman Empire looks to be a polity in terminal decline. And yet, all is not lost. Admist the near constant territorial retreat, a string of capable military-minded men would bring triumph to Byzantium and secure the long-time survival of the Empire for centuries to come. Can you walk in the footsteps of these great men?"

 bookmark_hee_norway_fairhair_desc: "Harald has just succeeded, on the death of his father Halfdan the Black, the sovereignty of several small, and somewhat scattered kingdoms in Vestfold, which had come into his father's hands through conquest and inheritance. Under his protector-regent, his maternal uncle Guthorm, Harald is but one of many chieftains that hold claim to the lands of the North. But Harald is not long to be considered a mere chieftain, for soon he will embark on an ambitious quest - the Unification of Norway itself.\n\n#bold With a lineage that claims descent from the Vanir God Freyr, Harald has ambitions to become a name that can rival his ancestor. Can you fulfill Harald's dream and become the First King of Norway?#!"

 bookmark_hee_norway_kjotve: "Kjotve 'the Rich'"
 bookmark_hee_norway_kjotve_desc: "Kjotve has lived his life by two things: cruelity and greed. For it was greed that lead him to overthrow Halfdan the Black, the previous King of Agder, and cruelity by which Kjotve has ruled ever since. Having grown rich from raids, and no small amount of taxes, Kjotve is content to rest on his laurels - if it weren't for the whispers of an ambitious young cub in the East, son of the very man Kjotve overthrew.\n\n#bold In the coming years, Kjotve would lead the western Norwegian kings against the upstart Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord; a battle he lost at great personal cost. Can you change history and ensure it will be your name that echoes throughout history?"

 bookmark_hee_norway_hakon_desc: "As son and heir of Grjotgard Herlaugsson Lade, Hakon has succeeded his father as ruler of the petty kingdom of Trøndelag. But not content with his limited holdings in the North, Hakon has ambitions to extend his kingdom southwards - which will soon bring him into contact with another ambitious king: Harald Fairhair. Historically, after some fighting, Hakon would come to terms with Harald, becoming his vassal in exchange for the young king marrying his daughter Asa.\n\n#bold History is not always a single path. Will you be content to follow history and bow to the young king Harald? Or will you forge a new path for you and your family?"

 bookmark_hee_norway_eirikr_desc: "Eirikr, King of Hordaland, has lived the life of a true viking. Raiding and pillaging, traveling over the seas, many could be jealous of the way he has lived his life, but it has not been without cost. Having lost his sons in raids, Eirikr holds close his daughter Gyda - a treasure he values more than gold or silver.\n\n#bold When you hear of a young upstart in the East ask for Gyda's hand, how will you react?"
