 bm_867_hee_transcaucasia_desc: "Located on the peripheries of Eastern Europe and West Asia, straddling the southern Caucasus Mountains, the region of Transcaucasia has been an arena for political, military, religious, and cultural rivalries and expansionism for centuries.\n\nIn the middle of the 8th century, with the capture of Derbend by the Umayyad armies during the Arab–Khazar wars, most of the South Caucasus became part of the Muslim Caliphate and Islam spread throughout the region. However, even with the onset of Islam, the regionnal nobility have fought to keep their power and a degree of independence from the Caliphs in the South, a struggle that most recently flared up with the Armenian revolt of 850–855; which ended with the Turkish general Bugha al-Kabir crushing the revolt and making many Caucasian magnates and princes captive and sent to the caliphal capital of Samarra.\n\n#bold Though with the Anarchy in Samarra, the control gained Bugha al-Kabir has been quickly reversed, as many in the region see the ongoing chaos as an opportunity to become the new masters of Transcaucasia..."

 bookmark_hee_armenian_ashot_i_desc: "With the decline of the previously ruling Mamikonian dynasty, the Bagratuni have emerged as one of the most powerful noble families in Armenia. Taking advantage of the crisis within the Abbasid Caliphate, Ashot has seen fit to expand his power through diplomacy with the neighboring Armenian princes and war with the local Muslim Emirs. His victory at the Battle of Karasounk saw him named "Prince of Princes" though his rule is no where near secured. With the Roman Empire to the West, Abbasid Caliphate to the South, and Khazar Khaganate to the North, Ashot's position seems precarious - but if he can utilize his advantages, it is also one of great opportunity. \n\n#bold Can you usher in Armenia's second Golden Age and ensure a prosperous future for your family and people?#!"

 bookmark_hee_armenian_ibn_ahmad_desc: "As the Ostikan (Governor) of Arminiya, al-Ala ibn Ahmad is in theory the most powerful man in the region. But the reality is much different. With the Abbasid central government in anarchy, and the power of the Armenian princes on the rise, al-Ala finds himself in command of a fragmented and rebellious province. Even many of the Muslim Emirs in the region pay him only lip service, if not outright oppose him.\n\n With no aid from Samarra, it is up to al-Ala ibn Ahmad to do what the famed general Bugha al-Kabir did just 20 years before - bring these rebellious lords to heel.\n\n#bold In control of only a single county, al-Ala ibn Ahmad's position seems untenable. But perhaps with the right guidance, al-Ala can bring order to this defiant state."

 bookmark_hee_armenian_kaysite_founder_desc: "When the Turk Bugha al-Kabir defeated the leading princes of Armenia following a revolt and took several prisoner from among them back to Samarra, a power vaccuum was created - one that Abu'l-Ward was happy to fill. Taking control of the region of Apahunik', which included the city of Manzikert, Abu'l-Ward has proven to be a very active and ambitious statesman who has made the Kaysites into one of the most influential families in Armenia - rivaled only by the Bagratids, the Artsrunis of Vaspurakan, and the princes of Syunik.\n\nHowever the Christians of Armenia still pose a significant threat to his rule and the Roman Empire is on the rise in the West.\n\n#bold If his words fail, you may have to rely on the sword. Can you ensure the first of the Kaysite Emirs is not the last?"

 bookmark_hee_armenian_haytham_ibn_khalid_desc: "Son of Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani and the grandson of Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani, both of whom had repeatedly served the Abbasid Caliphate as great generals and governors of Arminiya, Haytham has benefited greatly from the succession of Shaybanid governors that have enabled the family to become firmly entrenched in the region, especially in Shirvan, which came to be ruled directly by Haytham. Adopting the Persian title "Shirvanshah" following the murder of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, Haytham has essentially declared him and his realm de facto independent rulers of Shirvan.\n\n#bold The Shirvanshahs ruled from 861 to 1538, one of the most enduring dynasties of the Islamic world. Can you achieve the same and endure the long centuries of coming strife? The destiny of this great house rests with you."
