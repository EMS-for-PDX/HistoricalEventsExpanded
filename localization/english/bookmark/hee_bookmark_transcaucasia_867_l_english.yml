 bm_867_hee_transcaucasia_desc: "The Roman Empire is a shell of its former self.\n\nThree centuries earlier, the grand ambitions of Emperor Justinian had created a Mediterranean juggernaut worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as the Empires of Augustus and and Trajan. But now, little of Justinian's legacy remains.\n\nBellicose Lombards pushed the Empire to the very fringes of Italy, constant migrations of Slavs and Bulgars along the Danube chipped away at the Empire's Balkan territories, all while the rise of a natal Islamic state permenantly deprived the Romans of Syria, Egypt, North Africa.\n\n#bold The Roman Empire looks to be a polity in terminal decline. And yet, all is not lost. Admist the near constant territorial retreat, a string of capable military-minded men would bring triumph to Byzantium and secure the long-time survival of the Empire for centuries to come. Can you walk in the footsteps of these great men?"

 bookmark_hee_armenian_ashot_i_desc: "With the decline of the previously ruling Mamikonian dynasty, the Bagratuni have emerged as one of the most powerful noble families in Armenia. Taking advantage of the crisis within the Abbasid Caliphate, Ashot has seen fit to expand his power through diplomacy with the neighboring Armenian princes and war with the local Muslim Emirs. His victory at the Battle of Karasounk saw him named "Prince of Princes" though his rule is no where near secured. With the Roman Empire to the West, Abbasid Caliphate to the South, and Khazar Khaganate to the North, Ashot's position seems precarious - but if he can utilize his advantages, it is also one of great opportunity. \n\n#bold Can you usher in Armenia's second Golden Age and ensure a prosperous future for your family and people?#!"

 bookmark_hee_armenian_ibn_ahmad_desc: "As the Ostikan (Governor) of Arminiya, al-Ala ibn Ahmad is in theory the most powerful man in the region. But the reality is much different. With the Abbasid central government in anarchy, and the power of the Armenian princes on the rise, al-Ala finds himself in command of a fragmented and rebellious province. Even many of the Muslim Emirs in the region pay him only lip service, if not outright oppose him.\n\n With no aid from Samarra, it is up to al-Ala ibn Ahmad to do what the famed general Bugha al-Kabir did just 20 years before - bring these rebellious lords to heel.\n\n#bold In control of only a single county, al-Ala ibn Ahmad's position seems untenable. But perhaps with the right guidance, al-Ala can bring order to this defiant state."

 bookmark_hee_armenian_kaysite_founder_desc: "When the Turk Bugha al-Kabir defeated the leading princes of Armenia following a revolt and took several prisoner from among them back to Samarra, a power vaccuum was created - one that Abu'l-Ward was happy to fill. Taking control of the region of Apahunik', which included the city of Manzikert, Abu'l-Ward has proven to be a very active and ambitious statesman who has made the Kaysites into one of the most influential families in Armenia - rivaled only by the Bagratids, the Artsrunis of Vaspurakan, and the princes of Syunik.\n\nHowever the Christians of Armenia still pose a significant threat to his rule and the Roman Empire is on the rise in the West.\n\n#bold If his words fail, you may have to rely on the sword. Can you ensure the first of the Kaysite Emirs is not the last?"

Adopting the Persian title "Shirvanshah" following the murder of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, Haytham has essentially declared him and his realm de facto independent rulers of Shirvan.\n\n#bold The Shirvanshahs ruled from 861 to 1538, one of the most enduring dynasties of the Islamic world. Can you achieve the same and endure the long centuries of coming strife? The destiny of this great house rests with you."
