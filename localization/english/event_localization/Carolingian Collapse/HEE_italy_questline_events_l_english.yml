# Louis II of Italy
 HEE_italy_questline.0101.t: "Security in the South"
 HEE_italy_questline.0101.desc: "Despite my recent victory over the Muslims with the capture of Bari, Southern Italy remains unsecured. Whispers of a possible Muslim military response echo throughout the land and the defeated [sawdan.GetTitledFirstName] still hold great support among the populace - even the Lombard princes who invited me South for protection already begin to view my presence as an irritation.\n\nStill, I now possess the city of Bari - a prize that has long eluded me - though the question now becomes how best to secure it.\n\nWhile it could be a potential provocation, I could deploy a number of my troops to garrison key Christian-controlled forts in Southern Italy - which would serve both as a stabilizing force to the populace and a deterrent to my enemies."
 HEE_italy_questline.0101.a: "The South must remain secure."
 HEE_italy_questline.0101.b: "This would be a step too far."

 HEE_italy_questline.0131.t: "God works in strange ways"
 HEE_italy_questline.0131.desc: "Failure. That is what my attempt to flee back into friendly territory has ended in. Not only has my capital, Bari, now fallen to that Christian Emperor in the North, but now I find myself at their so-called mercy. Still, not all is lost. My captor [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName] is no true friend to [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] and has so far treated me well. He allows me to receive many visitors, and ironically enough, it seems I may be more popular amongst the people than their supposed Emperor.\n\nIt may be possible to twist my current imprisonment to my advantage - the Beneventian Prince seems quite malleable, but perhaps it would just be best to seek a more immediate end to my imprisonment..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0131.a: "Allah has given me this opportunity, I can not refuse it."
 HEE_italy_questline.0131.b: "Escape is the best and only real option."

 HEE_italy_questline.0132.t: "The Final Push"
 HEE_italy_questline.0132.desc: "For several days now, I have had the opportunity to speak with my "host" [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName]. And over time, I have glimpsed ever so slightly into the mind of this Christian Prince: His worries, doubts, and fears. It has fallen on him to preserve his ancient principality and its independence, and now that it seems the threat I once posed has diminished, he now ponders if the next threat comes from the North.\n\nThe Prince seems posed to take action against his former ally; it seems now I only need to say the right words to resonate with what he wishes to hear..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0132.a: "[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is an arrogant soul, he may think it his right to rule over you."
 HEE_italy_questline.0132.b: "[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is known for his greed, he might seek to steal your wealth and lands."
 HEE_italy_questline.0132.c: "[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is a fickle man, his word can not be trusted."

 HEE_italy_questline.0151.t: "Whom to trust..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0151.desc: "For some time now, [sawdan.GetTitledFirstName] has been an... unwilling recipient of Beneventian hospitality. And so I have taken the liberty of conversing with my once-foe on several occasions - a man who, despite his current situation, remains affable and cordial, bearing a poise I do not believe I could have in a similar situation.\n\nThough our conversation began on mundane subjects, it quickly shifted to a figure familiar to us both: [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]. The so-called Emperor of the Romans has seen fit in the aftermath of the triumph in Bari to occupy my fortresses and continue to infringe upon my city. I had hoped that the Emperor would be a useful counterweight to the Muslim threat, but now that the Muslim threat has vanished, perhaps he is now my Principality's greatest threat. My own thoughts are echoed by Sawdan's words as he speaks of Louis' reputation for vanity, greed, and fickleness. Is it possible for me to trust a man such as him?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0151.a: "[sawdan.GetTitledFirstName]'s words may hold some truth..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0151.b: "Does [sawdan.GetTitledFirstName] take me for a fool?"

 HEE_italy_questline.0152.t: "The Best Course of Action"
 HEE_italy_questline.0152.desc: "With a furrowed brow, you find yourself once more gazing out of the window of your chamber, watching the sun dip below the horizon. Your mind races, considering the delicate balance of power within the Italian peninsula. With his victory at Bari, [louis_the_younger.GetFirstNamePossessive] presence now looms large, casting a shadow over each of the Southern Italian realms, and may now pose a threat to the ancient principality in your care and its independence, which you seek to preserve.\n\nTurning your attention to the map spread out before you, you trace the borders of your realm with an unsteady hand. What action shall you take? What course shall you set that best ensures your prosperity and security and that of your people?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0152.a: "Swift action is best, my guard stands ready."
 HEE_italy_questline.0152.b: "It may be best to seek further support before acting."
 HEE_italy_questline.0152.c: "I will confront [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] personally."
 HEE_italy_questline.0152.d: "Perhaps now is not the time to act..."

 HEE_italy_questline.0153.t: "Letters of Intent"
 HEE_italy_questline.0153.desc: "In your chambers, surrounded by maps and parchments detailing your realm's affairs, you must ponder your next move against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]. [louis_the_younger.GetFirstNamePossessive] ambitions threaten not only your own domain but also the autonomy of *all* Southern Italian lords, and thus, you consider the idea of seeking assistance from the Lords of Spoleto, Capua, and Salerno.\n\nIn the quiet of your chambers, you ponder the implications of reaching out to these lords. Would they see the wisdom in joining forces against a common foe? Or would they view your proposal with suspicion, wary of your sincerity? Worst of all, they could themselves alert [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] of your plans, ruining the plans you have labored to keep hidden. Yet even with these concerns, the allure of a united front against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is undeniable..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0153.a: "The support of the Southern Lords is essential."
 HEE_italy_questline.0153.b: "The risk is too great."

 HEE_italy_questline.0171.t: "A Dangerous Proposition"
 HEE_italy_questline.0171.desc: "A relatively mundane day is made far more interesting when a messenger enters your hall with a letter bearing the seal of [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName]. Inside, you find yourself presented with a delicate proposition: a plea for aid from [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName], who seeks your support against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]. It seems the Prince fears that with the fall of Bari, the Emperor will seek to impose his rule over all of Southern Italy - Muslim and Christian alike.\n\nYou retire to the solitude of your chambers to ponder the weighty decision that this missive brings before you. Thoughts swirl in your mind as you consider the implications of aligning yourself with Adelchis. On one hand, the opportunity to challenge the authority of a ruler whose ambitions may threaten the autonomy of your Principality resonates deeply with you. On the other hand, there is no small amount of risk. Foremost among them is can Adelchis be trusted as an ally or does he plan to merely use you towards some unknown purpose?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0171.a: ""[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is indeed a threat, once best faced alongside allies.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0171.b: ""[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] has yet to prove himself my enemy.""

 HEE_italy_questline.0154.t: "The Time for Action"
 HEE_italy_questline.0154.desc: "With the replies from the other lords of Southern Italy now in hand, the pieces of your plan finally begin to fall into place, and the time to move against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] moves ever closer. As you convene with your advisors and trusted confidants, plans begin to take shape with a clarity born of determination and purpose. The Southern Italian lords, once divided by petty rivalries and squabbles, now stand united in their resolve to challenge the authority of Louis II and assert their authority over Southern Italy.\n\nBut even as you revel in the prospect of victory, a shadow of doubt lingers in the recesses of your mind. Will this alliance you have forged prove strong enough to withstand the trials that lie ahead? Can you trust your newfound allies to remain steadfast in the face of adversity, or will they falter when the moment of truth arrives? As your advisors and trusted confidants look to you for direction, is it finally time to take action?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0154.a: ""We move against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] at once!""
 HEE_italy_questline.0154.b: ""I have changed my mind, it is not time to move against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName].""

 HEE_italy_questline.0102.t: "Betrayal in Benevento"
 HEE_italy_questline.0102.desc: "A calm night is interrupted by the sounds of heavy footsteps echoing outside your chambers in the corridor. Before you can question the cause or source of the noise, [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName] and a number of his guards burst into your chambers, their faces twisted with determination and hostility. The scene before you turns swiftly to one of chaos and confusion as your family and attendants react with shock and alarm to the sudden intrusion.\n\nYour mind races as you struggle to comprehend the reason for this unexpected intrusion, but the fog of confusion lifts ever so slightly as the Prince approaches you. The cold steel of his voice cuts through the air like a dagger as he accuses you of treachery and treason against Benevento - his words dripping with venomous intent as he demands the surrender of you, your family, and your guard. You glance at the small number of household guards at your disposal, who await your orders with swords drawn. Though outnumbered, they will fight to the death to defend you if you give the order, but will you?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0102.a: ""Lay down your weapons men, no one shall be harmed.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0102.b: ""To arms men!""

 HEE_italy_questline.0155.t: "Appeal from a Higher Power"
 HEE_italy_questline.0155.desc: "While I believed that imprisoning [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] would ease my burdens, it seems to have created some new ones. My court chaplain for some days now has been in a sore mood and has now revealed the reason why. He has come to me requesting the immediate release of [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]. His words speak to the importance of mercy and forgiveness, of upholding the principles of justice and compassion even in the face of uncertainity.\n\nWhile my chaplain certainly speaks well, it does nothing to alleviate my fears of what might occur if I allow [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] to go free. Still, the request of my chaplain demands a response."
 HEE_italy_questline.0155.a: ""You may be right. [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free at once.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0155.b: ""[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free, on some conditions...""
 HEE_italy_questline.0155.c: ""I am no fool! [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] can not go free!""

 HEE_italy_questline.0156.t: "Appeal from a Higher Power"
 HEE_italy_questline.0156.desc: "For the second time in as many weeks, you find yourself confronted by [bishop_of_benevento.GetTitledFirstName] on the subject of [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]'s imprisonment. It seems my previous answer did not settle the matter for [bishop_of_benevento.GetTitledFirstName], and thus, I again am subjected to a lecture on the need to release [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nAlthough this appeal calls not on the importance of traditional Christian values such as mercy and forgiveness but on the political necessity of [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]'s release. [bishop_of_benevento.GetTitledFirstName] claims that to continue to hold the Emperor will only invite chaos to our realm, both from Christians seeking retribution for [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]'s imprisonment and by Muslims who may be emboldened when they hear the news. It seems I must again make my stance on this issue clear…"
 HEE_italy_questline.0156.a: ""You may be right. [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free at once.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0156.b: ""[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free, on some conditions...""
 HEE_italy_questline.0156.c: ""I am no fool! [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] can not go free!""

 HEE_italy_questline.0157.t: "Third Times the Charm?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0157.desc: "For days, you have heard murmurings about your court about your treatment of [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName], the voices seeming to increase with each passing hour. And now, yet again, you find yourself grappling with a familiar dilemma as your court chaplain approaches you with a request for the release of [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] from prison. Despite your previous refusals, the chaplain's unwavering persistence serves as a constant reminder of the weight of the decision you took to stem [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName]'s ambitions.\n\nIt seems only yesterday my court supported my action against [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName], but it seems their memory is short, as now they grumble and moan about the cost of such imprisonment - and deride me for doing so. Have they so quickly forgotten the threat that [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] poses to our independence? But it seems despite my previous answers, I must once more make my position clear on this subject..."
 HEE_italy_questline.0157.a: ""You may be right. [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free at once.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0157.b: ""[louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] may go free, on some conditions...""
 HEE_italy_questline.0157.c: ""Silence! I will hear NO more on this subject!""

 HEE_italy_questline.0103.t: "The Price of Freedom"
 HEE_italy_questline.0103.desc: "Some time has passed since your capture, and you continue to remain confined to the boundaries of this chamber. The room's modest decor does little to mask the fact that - while this room contains neither bars nor chains - it remains a prison all the same. The days have stretched on, each passing moment a testament to both the injustice and indignity of your captivity.\n\nSuddenly, the heavy wooden door creaks open, admitting a shaft of dim light that pierces the gloom of your solitude. [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName] enters, flanked by a retinue of guards, as the sight of him fills you with equal parts anticipation and apprehension as you ponder why he has come. With a voice like ice, Adelchis demands that you swear an oath on the Book never to return to Benevento nor seek revenge for your imprisonment if you wish to secure freedom for yourself and your family. The audacity of his demands leaves you reeling, a bitter taste of indignation rising in your throat as you contemplate the choice before you."
 HEE_italy_questline.0103.a: ""I shall swear [adelchis.GetFirstName], but never forgive nor forget.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0103.b: ""I will never agree to these terms [adelchis.GetFirstName].""

 HEE_italy_questline.0160.t: "To the Future"
 HEE_italy_questline.0160.desc: "With [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] now free, you contemplate the implications of your actions. Doubts gnaw at the edges of your consciousness, no doubt the echoes of the reasons you had to act against him to begin with.\n\nWill Louis honor the terms of his release, or will he seek retribution for his unjust imprisonment despite his oath? The uncertainty of it all looms large in your mind, a reminder of the precariousness of action and the fragility of power. But it remains out of your hands now. [louis_the_younger.GetTitledFirstName] is now free, or as free as one shackled by a title can be, and you only can hope that your paths never cross again."
 HEE_italy_questline.0160.a: ""It rests in God's hands now...""

 HEE_italy_questline.0104.t: "The Way Forward"
 HEE_italy_questline.0104.desc: "For too long, you were subject to the deceitful machinations of Adelchis of Benevento, but now you stand liberated from the chains of unjust imprisonment. The taste of freedom is sweet upon your lips, a welcome reprieve from the darkness that once threatened to engulf you and your family.\n\nYet, as you survey the landscape before you, a nagging shadow lingers in the recesses of your mind. The shame of your imprisonment, and the oath that you were compelled to swear, hangs over you. To be absolved of my oath, and be free of my shame, would require the intervention of the clergy - and among the clergy, only the Pope is suitable for one of my rank.\n\nBut Rome is its own beast, and many among my party seek the comfort of home in the North. Indeed, even a part of me wishes the same. Nevertheless, the choice naturally falls to me, so the question remains: which path shall I follow?"
 HEE_italy_questline.0104.a: ""The Eternal City awaits.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0104.b: ""What I seek most at this moment is the comfort of home.""

 HEE_italy_questline.0105.t: "A Holy Audience"
 HEE_italy_questline.0105.desc: "Having recently arrived in Rome, you stand before the hallowed halls of the Vatican, anticipation coursing through your veins as you prepare to meet with the Pope. The doors swing open before you, revealing the grandeur of the papal audience chamber in all its splendor. The air is thick with incense and the murmurs of attendants, a palpable sense of reverence filling the space as you approach the throne where the Pope sits in solemn silence.\n\nWith a deep breath, you kneel before His Holiness, your heart pounding in your chest as you plead your case. You speak of your recent imprisonment at the hands of [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName], of the injustices that have been visited upon you and your family. You beseech the Pope for absolution and release from the oath you were forced to swear under duress. The Pope hears your words and offers a release to your oath and an opportunity to erase all shame from your name: a second crowning as Emperor of the Romans."
 HEE_italy_questline.0105.a: ""Your words do me great honor, I would gladly accept.""
 HEE_italy_questline.0105.b: ""While your words are welcome, I respectfully must decline.""

 HEE_italy_questline.0106.t: "The Second Crowning"
 HEE_italy_questline.0106.desc: "The interior of St. Peter's Basilica is illuminated by the soft glow of candlelight as I enter this sacred space, accompanied by my retinue, which is comprised of a solemn procession. The air is heavy with anticipation as the faithful gather to witness a momentous occasion - my second coronation as Emperor of the Romans, blessed by the Holy Father himself. I kneel before the Pope, who is clad in resplendent robes of crimson and gold, as the pontiff raises his hand in benediction, signalling the beginning of the sacred ceremony.\n\nIn a voice that resonates with authority, the Pope bestows his blessing upon me, invoking the favor of the Almighty as he places the imperial crown upon his head. The hushed murmurs of the assembled crowd swell to a crescendo as the momentous occasion unfolds before them, the echoes of history reverberating through these hallowed halls.\n\nBut even as the cheers of the faithful fill the air, a solemn undertone lingers beneath the surface - the matter of my oath to [adelchis.GetTitledFirstName], a stain upon my honor that cannot be ignored. With a gesture of solemn grace, the Pope turns to me, his expression grave as he speaks words of absolution, washing away the shame of my recent captivity and releasing me from the bonds of my oath. With the ceremony complete, the Pope beckons me to stand and bask again in the glory of the title I have received once more."
 HEE_italy_questline.0106.a: "I rise once more as imperator Romanorum "

# Siege of Salerno
 HEE_siege_of_salerno.0001.t: "Hat's off to You"
 HEE_siege_of_salerno.0001.desc: "The midday sun cast its golden glow over the bustling forum as I made my way back to the palace, the scent of spices and fresh bread mingling in the warm air. My hair was still damp from the baths, and I adjusted the cap atop my head, a finely embroidered piece gifted to me by a local artisan. The crowd parted respectfully, though I caught the occasional curious glance. Among them, a man—an Arab merchant, by his garb and the richness of his wares—stepped forward, his expression polite but intrigued.\n\n“Your Excellency,” he said in a lilting voice, his words accented but clear, “that cap of yours—such craftsmanship! It speaks of refinement and taste. A prince’s adornment, truly.” His compliment was genuine, his tone warm. I paused, struck by his candor, and found myself smiling. In this moment, he was not an emissary of a foreign land or a reminder of the struggles that beset our borders, but simply a man admiring the beauty of another’s possession."

It seems he has returned from Ifrīqiya not with the usual cargo of spices and silks, but with words he claimed could save this city. When he speaks, it is of a great Muslim fleet preparing to descend upon Southern Italy in retaliation for the recent loss of Bari - with Salerno as their first target. This knowledge, he said, came from an unexpected source: an Arab merchant who wore a princely cap.\n\nThe weight of the news was staggering. My mind raced with the implications. Yet, amid the threat, I could not help but feel a flicker of gratitude. A single act of generosity had sown the seeds of goodwill across distant waters, delivering a chance to prepare where none might have existed - that is, if this merchant does indeed speaks the truth..."

The threat from Ifrīqiya loomed like a storm on the horizon, and though my men were brave and my walls strong, I knew the might of the Muslim fleet was not to be underestimated. Salerno could not stand alone against such an onslaught. My people’s lives, their homes, their future—it was all at stake, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on me like iron.\n\nI turned my thoughts to the lords of Southern Italy. We were a land divided, our rivalries often more bitter than any foreign foe, yet this threat was no petty squabble. The flames of Ifrīqiyan wrath would consume more than just Salerno if left unchecked. Could I bring them to my cause? Could ancient grudges be set aside to face this common enemy?

 HEE_siege_of_salerno.0007.desc: "The envoy arrives at my court under a darkened sky, their cloaks damp from the journey and their faces tense with urgency. At their head was Guaimar, the son of Prince Guaifer of Salerno, whose presence signals the importance of his message. His arrival was not unexpected - I had been informed of the boy's journey north some days ago - but the words he spoke were.\n\nHis words painted a grim picture: a great Muslim army had been gathered and would soon fall on Salerno - their banners advancing in retaliation for my conquest of Bari. The fall of Bari had been a victory for Christendom, a testament to the strength of my reign and my duty as Emperor. Yet, the price of that victory had become clear - and whose cost now fell to Salerno. As Guaimar falls silent, the whole court awaits my response. All know my next words will echo far beyond these walls..."

I sat in silence for a moment, letting the weight of the news settle. Around me, the murmurs of my council grew louder, outrage and disbelief filling the chamber. Some called it a humiliation, others an affront to our faith. All demanded retribution. Their voices rose like a storm, urging swift vengeance against the infidels who dared to defy us.\n\nIt does not take long for all eyes in the room to seek my reaction.

 HEE_siege_of_salerno.0101.desc: "The air in the council chamber was tense as my marshal unfurled the map of Southern Italy, his finger tracing the jagged coastline. “Salerno, Benevento, Naples—each a ripe target, Emir,” he said, his voice calm but heavy with purpose. “The Christians celebrate their victory at Bari, but their unity is fragile. A swift strike by sea will shatter their illusion of strength and remind them of our power.”\n\nI studied the map, the names of those cities carrying the weight of opportunity and risk. Salerno stood defiant, its prince foolishly bold; Benevento, a landlocked prize, relied on its neighbors for strength; and Naples, ever a thorn, lay exposed by the sea. “A naval strike,” I murmured, considering the marshal’s plan. The fleet of Ifrīqiya had long been our sharpest blade, and to wield it now would be to strike fear into their hearts. Yet I knew this campaign would demand precision—choose poorly, and we would squander what remained of our momentum."

 give_your_cap_to_the_arab: "Moved by his appreciation or perhaps simply due to your generous nature, you shall gift the merchant the cap he so admires. Perhaps in this city so often divided by trade, culture, and faith, a simple gesture such as this will bridge the distance - if only for a fleeting moment."
 thank_the_arab_for_his_compliment: "The Arab's comment is appreciated and has earned your thanks - nothing more and nothing less."
 dismiss_the_arab: "For one such as this - whether it be his station or faith - to address you so directly can only be an affront. It is best to publicly dismiss him before others begin to exhibit the same improper familiarity."

 believe_the_warning_and_prepare_salerno: "This warning is too great to ignore or delay. Salerno must be ready for this invasion - the city must be fortified, provisions must be gathered, the garrison must be strengthened, and the people must be warned!"
 ask_your_spymaster_to_confirm_the_rumors: "While the merchant's warning is indeed grave, that does not mean it is true. His words could be false, or himself decieved. To act in haste is to invite disaster, and thus it is only right to first confirm such a threat before acting on it."
 dismiss_the_merchant_rumors: "The Merchant's words begets disbelief. A surprise Muslim attack betrayed by the giving of a single cap? Even the greatest of playwrights would struggle to come up with such a tale!"

 request_aid_from_southern_italian_lords: "The Muslim fleet is a threat not only to you, but to all Christians in the South of Italy. As such, it is only right to call on all Christian lords to confront the threat. United - and by the grace of God - you will repel all who threaten your city."
