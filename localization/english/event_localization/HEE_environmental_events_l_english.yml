 HEE_environmental.0002.desc:0 "For some time now, the air has felt different. Warmer in the summer, and less biting in the winters. For several seasons our crops have flourished as the rain has fallen aplenty. While once we might have feared we would not be able to feed our own come the winter, now both our bellies and storehouses are filled in equal measure.\n\nAcross the realm, people's moods seemed to have improved along with the weather, as moods are high, for while the struggles of daily life continue, the cold, atleast for the moment, is not one of them."

 HEE_environmental.0101.t:0 "A New Star"
 HEE_environmental.0101.desc:0 "Astronomers around the world have reported a most fascinating, unprecedented anomaly: the appearance of a new star in the sky.\n\nStars appearing out of nowhere is abnormal, but hardly unheard of. What is extraordinary about this new star is that it is extremely bright, even more than Venus, which is normally the brightest celestial body after the sun and the moon. In fact, ordinary people have reported seeing it during the day, too.\n\nMany are debating whether this unusual star is just a minor if odd phenomenon, or an event of great importance. Regardless, astronomers who are observing it say it does have some strange properties and behaviors. For example, it dims or brightens or flickers almost at random, or even disappears for weeks at a time.\n\nOne can only wonder what this new star represents, or why it is the way it is, and how long it will stay in the sky."

 HEE_environmental.0101.c:0 "It is truly a wondrous sight, isn't it?"
 HEE_environmental.0101.info:0 "\n#emphasis Historical Context:#! SN 1006, as it is called nowadays, was a supernova about 7200 light years away which appeared in 1006 and is the brightest observed stellar event in recorded history that we know of.\n\nSN 1006 is attested in records from all across the world, from official Chinese histories, to a text by the Iranian scholar Ibn Sina, to the annals of the Abbey of Saint Gall in Switzerland, and more. Based on these sources, scholars have calculated that the supernova was first sighted in April of 1006; it may have been visible for a few more years after that.\n\nThere were two subsequent supernova events during the medieval period in 1054 and 1181, but these were not as bright as SN 1006. Both were attested in Chinese and Japanese records, and by a Nestorian Arab source in the case of 1054, but other records of sightings of these two in other places around the world are debatable."

 HEE_environmental.0201.t: "The Earth's Wrath"
 HEE_environmental.0201.desc: "It begins with a rumble. A low, ominous sound that reverberates through the earth like the growl of a slumbering giant. At first, you dismiss it as nothing more than perhaps the rumblings of a passing storm, but as the tremors intensify, you realize the true magnitude of the catastrophe that is unfolding before you.\n\nBuildings shake and crumble as the ground beneath your feet heaves and buckles, sending panic rippling through the streets of your city. People scream and flee in terror, but their cries and lives are lost amidst the cacophony of destruction that is created by the collapsing walls of structures that just yesterday they may have called home.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, you are filled with a profound sense of helplessness, a realization that even the mightiest of rulers are powerless in the face of nature's wrath. In the distance, you can see plumes of smoke rising into the sky, a grim reminder of the devastation that has been wrought upon your once-proud city."
