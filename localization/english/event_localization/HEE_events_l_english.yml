 HEE_religious_spawns.1.desc:0 "[hasan11th.GetFirstName], the alleged Eleventh Shia Imam by divine command and by the decrees of the previous Imams, has passed away. While leading a life in precautionary dissimulation, in fear of persecution from the [caliphate.GetName], Imam [hasan11th.GetFirstName] was known to be endowed with divine knowledge and would critize muslim rulers who appropriated the wealth of their nations or those who extorted people under their rule; who also lead a life of critic towards the [caliphate.GetName] who [hasan11th.GetFirstName] proclaimed ruled with the hand of terror. \n\nWith his death comes the large question of succession, for which many groups throughout the middle east believed for if [hasan11th.GetFirstName], had a son, The son would grow to be the famed Mahdi, an eschatological redeemer of Islam and the one who will arrive with Isa to bring peace and justice to the world. Without such, many are questioning the future."

 # HEE Fairhair Storyline

 HEE_fairhair.2.t:0 "A feast and your daughter."
 HEE_fairhair.2.desc:0 "As the feast starts into motion, my guests move to sit around the table or gather near the fire, although when starting to eat, I can't stop myself remembering that I had ordered my daughter, [gyda.GetName], to stay put in her room for the night. However I can clearly see her mingling with the guests and partaking in the festivities.\n\nI wonder if it would not be better for my daughter to retire for the night, after all, she is but a young girl surronded by increasingly drunken men. Then again, it does seem she is enjoying herself and the atmosphere..."
 HEE_fairhair.2.a:0 "Perhaps my guests wouldn't mind."
 HEE_fairhair.2.b:0 "My guests are a bunch of drunken men, she wouldn't be safe."

 HEE_fairhair.3.t:0 "Valhalla on Earth?"
 HEE_fairhair.3.desc:0 "I wander the great hall of [location.GetNameNoTooltip]. The sound of music and song assaults the ear with their intensity, the heat of the fireplace brings comforting warmth, and the main table's seats are filled with the realm's mightiest drunks. The usual feast indeed, but a boring one. \n\nThinking about the best time to exit quietly, I turn my head towards the door when I see out of the corner of my eye one of the most beautiful sights I'd ever laid my eyes upon - it was the daughter of the host [fatherboi.GetName],\n[gyda.GetName]. \n\nShe bears the face that quickly takes a hold of my mind. Whatever it takes, this woman will become mine. I crave it. This may be my best time to speak with her... but perhaps I should simply let her be..."
 HEE_fairhair.3.a:0 "Approach Her"
 HEE_fairhair.3.b:0 "Leave her alone"

 HEE_fairhair.4.t:0 "Is that a challenge?"
 HEE_fairhair.4.desc:0 "As I approach her, I go to introduce myself. However she quickly shuts me down before I can utter a single word. Although that should have been the end of the discussion; her voice was also a thing of wonder and I yearned to hear more. \n\nWhen I go to follow her as she walks away, [gyda.GetName] turns to face me once more; \n"You warriors are all the same! You could conquer and be king over all of Norway, and I'd still think twice about talking once more with you...." \n\nAs she walks away, I ponder, was that a challenge? A Quest? Is that what I would need to achieve to make her mine? To unify all of Norway is no small task, but perhaps it is worth it for a woman like her...."
 HEE_fairhair.4.a:0 "I'll do it, and to prove my commitment, I won't cut nor brush my hair until it's done"
 HEE_fairhair.4.b:0 "Seems like a lot of work for someone, plenty of fish in the sea right?"

 HEE_fairhair.6.desc:0 "News has come in from the south land that the people of Hordaland and Rogaland, Agder and Thelemark, are gathering, and bringing together ships and weapons, as well as a great body of men. It seems the lords of Southern Norway have heard of my pledge to become their king, and have banded together to stop my quest in its path.\n\n[king_eirikr.GetName] has sent a messanger who declares that as long as I forfeit my ambitions towards the throne of Norway and his daughter all will be forgiven, but should I persist in my quest I will be crushed by the mighty army he has gathered.\n\nThe time is now to decide if my love for [gyda.GetName], or desire to be king, merits the coming battle..."
