 HEE_great_summer_army.0003.t: "A Question of Faith"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0003.desc: "Traditionally, our people have employed the use of puppet rulers over our conquered lands to pacify the people. However Edmund, the former King of East Anglia, has refused to comply with your demands. Deciding to give him one last opportunity, I venture into the dungeon to speak with him.\n\nWhile your men release him from his bindings, you ask him "Oh miserable King Edmund of East Anglia, you have had the night to rethink my offer. How do you answer?"\n\nStruggling to regain any shred of the dignity associated with his title of king, he stammers, "I...I have considered your offer and, yes, I will continue to rule East Anglia as you suggest. I will suffer your presence. I will provide you with horses, food, coin, and hostages. I will do all that you demand. But...only if you, Lord Guttorm, and all your men...submit to God. That is my demand. You must be baptized.""
 HEE_great_summer_army.0003.a: ""I must be what?""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0004.t: "A Christian Washing"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0004.desc: "Off to the side, one of my men scoffs at the request: "I have heard of this rite. You must stand in a barrel of water and they pour more water over you!"\n\nConfused, you ask, "You want to wash me?"\n\nKing Edmund mutters "No..." while another of your men speaks up, "Your scent upsets them!"\n\nAnnoyed, King Edmund raises his voice, "No, to cleanse you of your sins! There is only one God and I demand you serve him!"\n\nHis words seem to upset one of your men who shout, "Kill him now!" but Edmund's words have intrigued you - "Why must I serve him?"\n\nThe defeated King raises a hand to the sky, "Because God is great, all-powerful, all-magnificent."\n\nYour irritated man replies, "Have him stop his yapping and prove it!""
 HEE_great_summer_army.0004.a: ""Ah, agreed. Prove to me your God is great""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0005.t: "The Proof of St. Sebastian"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0005.desc: "King Edmund seems offended, "Prove it? Look here!" He pulls out a necklace necklace from around his neck, addorned with only a small wooden figure of a half-naked man with indents in his chest. "This is Saint Sebastian! A Roman Soldier who refused to renounce his faith and was struck with arrows for it, but he survived!"\n\n"So he lived?" you ask.\n\nEdmund pauses, "Well, he was then clubbed to death..."\n\n"So he still died?" you ask, confused.\n\n"Because it was God's will!"\n\n"So, would your God protect you from my arrows?" you ask.\n\nOne of your men scoff, "If he was all-powerful, he would."\n\n"Yes, if it was God's will, he would yes!" proclaims Edmund."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0005.a: ""So let us try.""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0006.t: "Proof of God"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0006.desc: "With Edmund's declaration of God's power, you decide to test him. "We shall shoot arrows at you and, if you survive...we will all be washed."\n\nEdmund is rendered speechless for many long moments, before he tries to walk back his demands, "Very well. I will continue to be king but we will dispense with the need for the baptisms. The, uh... washing. I withdraw my request."\n\nHowever Edmund's piteful words do not temper your newfound interest in the supposed power of this God. "But you claim your God is all-powerful. I want it proven."\n\nTurning to your guards, you order Edmund to be stripped as you motion for your archers to take their positions. However, before this test of the Christian God, you have one last question for the King."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0006.a: ""Tell me truthfully, are you afraid?""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0007.t: "The Martyrdom of Edmund"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0007.desc: "Edmund, though scared, seemed strangely defiant. "God is great."\n\n"We shall see."\n\nAs your men nock their arrows, Edmund grows restless, "Shoot...Shoot!" he cries. But you caution your men, "Ah...These are my men, and only I tell them when to shoot." Hearing this, Edmund lets out a breath he had been holding.\n\n"Shoot"\n\nEdmund's eyes can only widen as he is shoot by multiple arrows. Falling to the ground, Edmund gasps for breath. Walking over to stand over the arrow-ridden King, you ask, "Do you now wish to be clubbed, or will the arrows be sufficient?"\n\nEdmund has no answer as the life fades from his eyes and his gasps fall silent."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0008.desc: "Though we have conquered East Anglia, its lands are wet and swampy. It is not suitable for settlement. However the rich lands of Wessex are. Comprised mainly of farmers, they should offer no resistence at the sight of our might."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0008.a: ""To Wessex!""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0010.t: "Beginnings of Greatness"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0010.desc: "As I walk through the Royal Palace at Winchester, lead by members of the clergy to the Great Hall where I am to be coronated, I can not help but consider the task set before me.\n\nAs I step into the Great Hall, I am met with my chaplain, a goblet of holy water, and a crowd filled with noble and clergymen alike. Coming to a stop in front of the goblet, I am stripped of my tunic as my chaplain begins to annoint my body with holy water.\n\n"Our God, in his heaven, we ask you to find favor with your devoted servant Alfred. Bless him with courage, strength, and wisdom. Never leave his side. Amen." The crowd echoes, "Amen." "Allow him pure and holy thoughts and the power to carry out your work on this earth as our king. Allow this anointing of Alfred to enable your will."\n\nSpeaking directly to me the chaplain continues, "You are God's King, Alfred of Wessex. Vivat Rex Alfredus!" The crowd, solemnly echoes his words, "Vivat Rex Alfredus! Vivat Rex Alfredus!""
 HEE_great_summer_army.0010.a: "Accept the Crown of Wessex"

 HEE_great_summer_army.0011.t: "The Possibility of Peace"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0011.desc: "The weight of the crown still feels foreign upon my brow, heavier than I ever imagined. Now, scarcely settled upon the throne of Wessex, I face the relentless tide of Guthrum and his Northmen. Their ferocity has shaken even our stoutest defenses, their presence a shadow that looms over my fledgling rule. As I sit in the dim light of my hall, the question gnaws at me: should I offer a truce? To seek terms with Guthrum could buy us time — time to rebuild, to gather strength — but it would come at a cost.\n\nWould the people see it as wisdom or weakness? Would it embolden the Danes, convincing them that Wessex bends too easily? And yet, to fight now, with our forces battered and our spirits strained, might mean utter ruin. I cannot ignore the peril that surrounds me, but neither can I act rashly. Guthrum is as cunning as he is ruthless, and a truce may merely delay his hunger. Still, in this fragile moment, survival must guide my hand. Perhaps peace, however bitter, is the key to enduring."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0011.a: "Peace is the only path..."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0012.t: "An Offer of Peace"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0012.desc: "The messenger’s words lingered in the air as I sat in my hall, the flicker of the firelight casting long shadows across the faces of my warriors. Alfred of Wessex, the young king who has defied us at every turn, now seeks peace. A curious thing, this offer—was it born of desperation, his forces weakened by our raids? Or is there something more to this Alfred, a cunning I have yet to fully grasp? He wishes to meet, to speak of terms, but the question burns: what does peace with the Saxons truly mean for us?\n\nLand and gold — these are the lifeblood of my people, the spoils of war that drive us forward. If I were to accept his peace, it must come with tribute enough to satisfy my men and lands to provide for our people. Yet there is power in the sword as well, and I wonder if this truce is a ploy, a pause before Alfred strikes back. Still, a meeting could offer much — insight, leverage, and perhaps the foundation of something lasting.\n\nFor now, I will weigh his offer - though my blade remains close at hand."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0012.a: ""A meeting would be best.""
 HEE_great_summer_army.0012.b: ""Bah, there shall be no peace with Saxons!""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0013.t: "The Price of Peace"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0013.desc: "The air in the tent was thick with tension as I faced Guthrum and his war chiefs. Their eyes gleamed with a mix of disdain and confidence, the expressions of men who believed they held the upper hand. Guthrum’s voice, steady and unwavering, laid out his terms: land and gold. Essex, including London, to fall under their rule, and a tribute to sate their greed. The demand struck like a hammer blow, the price steep enough to choke the breath from my lungs. Yet I kept my face impassive, betraying none of the storm raging within me.\n\nThe war has cost us dearly — fields burned, villages razed, families shattered. To continue would mean more blood, more loss, and perhaps even the end of Wessex itself. But to give away land, to yield London, feels like carving a piece from my very soul. As Guthrum waited for my reply, I measured my options. Could this truce grant us time to rebuild, to rally? Or would it only embolden the Danes further? The weight of the realm pressed upon me as I opened my mouth to speak."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0013.a: "The cost is steep, but necessary"

 HEE_great_summer_army.0014.t: "Southern Ambitions"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0014.desc: "As I stand on the shores of the Thames, the fertile lands of Wessex call to me once more like a siren. Every time I look upon them, I feel the weight of ambition stir within me - The rolling hills, the rich farmlands, the wealth of this kingdom, it could all be mine! But for every conquest, there is risk. My forces are strong, yet the toll of war has begun to wear on my men. If we press again into Wessex, how many will fall? The bloodshed would be costly, and every warrior lost is another crack in my power, a chance for a younger, bolder lord to rise up against me.\n\nThe thought nags at me. There must be a better way to claim what I desire without spilling so much blood. My mind drifts to Wessex itself. Surely, not all the ealdormen are as loyal to Alfred as they claim. There are those who, with the right push, might turn their coats, swayed by promises of power and land. Perhaps I need not conquer Wessex through force alone. Perhaps it is time to play a subtler game, one of treachery and persuasion."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0015.t: "Whispers from the Northmen"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0015.desc: "The whispers reach me as I sit in my hall, quiet and unsettling. Guthrum, the Northman, seeking to negotiate with those of us who might be more... open-minded. The thought gnaws at me. Could it be true? My mind races. Wessex stands strong for now, but how long can we hold back the tide of the Northmen? The strain is growing, the weight of the struggle wearing on my people. The risk of defeat looms larger each day.\n\nI think of my family, my lands, and of the future I could secure. A pact with Guthrum — though treacherous — could offer us protection, privileges, and a place at the table of power. Would it be so wrong to align with the Northmen if it means survival? I would be a fool to ignore the opportunity. Betraying my king would bring shame, yes, but I would be ensuring the safety of my kin. The question lingers: loyalty or pragmatism? If Wessex falls, what loyalty is left to serve?"

 HEE_great_summer_army.0016.t: "Terms"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0016.desc: "The flickering light of the fire casts long shadows as I sit across from Guthrum, the Northman, his piercing gaze ever calculating. I’ve heard enough of his terms—the price of survival, of power. He speaks of land, of protection, of the future he promises. But I know the cost: Alfred, the King of Wessex, must fall.\n\n"I will need assurances," I say, my voice steady, though my heart beats a little faster. "My power, my lands—they must remain mine. I am not some puppet to be played."\n\nGuthrum’s lips curl into a half-smile, as though he knew what I would say. "Your power will be yours, Wulfhere, as long as you help me secure Wessex. Bring Alfred to me. Lure him to your estate, where he will not expect the trap."\n\nI feel the weight of the decision. Betrayal weighs heavy on me, but the reward—the safety of my family, my future—it's too tempting to ignore. Could I truly set my king up to die? The thought sickens me, but the price of defiance may be greater."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0017.b: "I must decline."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0018.t: "Death has Arrived"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0018.desc: "The clash of steel and the screams of the dying jolted me awake, the haze of sleep ripped away by the terrible reality unfolding around me. I stumbled to my feet, the heavy scent of blood and smoke filling the air. Shadows danced wildly on the walls, and through the window, I glimpsed the Northmen, their torches blazing like wicked stars as they tore through the estate.\n\nPanic surged within me, but I forced it down. My mind raced. I had no time to don armor or summon guards—if any still lived. I could hear the cries of women and children, the brutal laughter of the invaders. The Northmen were relentless, and this attack was no accident; they had come for me.\n\nI grabbed my sword and peered into the darkened corridor. Confusion clawed at me, but I could not falter. Escape? Fight? Rally whoever might still stand? Every decision felt like a gamble, but hesitation would mean death—for me and for Wessex. I had to act, and I had to act now."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0018.a: ""We must flee!""

 HEE_great_summer_army.0019.t: "A King without a Kingdom"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0019.desc: "The cold wind bit at my face as I gazed out over the desolate marshes, the weight of my defeat pressing heavily upon me. The Northmen’s surprise attack had left me a king in name only—a refugee in my own kingdom. The few loyal followers who remained were silent, their faces marked with the same despair that churned in my heart. My thoughts turned to Frankia, where so many Saxon kings had fled before me, finding safety but losing their thrones—and their dreams.\n\nThe temptation was there, to abandon this battered land and seek refuge across the sea. But how could I? How could I face my ancestors, my people, or even myself, knowing I had surrendered all hope of Wessex’s survival? Yet to fight back seemed impossible. The odds were insurmountable, my forces scattered, my resources all but gone. Still, deep within, a flicker of resolve remained. I could not let this be the end. Perhaps the marshes could become my sanctuary, my forge, where I would rebuild and strike back against the invaders."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0019.a.tt: "Your kingdom may be lost, but hope remains. As long as your resolve stays strong, it may yet be possible to expel the Northmen and restore your kingship. But for now, you must begin a resistance campaign in the marshes of Somerset."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0020.t: "From the Swamps..."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0020.desc: "The marshes of Somerset stretched endlessly around me, a desolate refuge yet filled with the quiet promise of resilience. Here, surrounded by water and reeds, I felt the pulse of Wessex still beating faintly, refusing to be silenced. The Northmen may think me broken, a fugitive clinging to life, but they do not understand the spirit of this land or its people. I could not let fear or despair take root. The fight was far from over.\n\nIf Wessex is to rise again, it must begin here, in these very marshes. I must send word to the loyal militias, to the scattered nobles hiding in fear. They must know their king still stands, that the Northmen’s grip on our land is not absolute. From these reeds, I would spark the fire of resistance, building an army from the loyalty and defiance of my people. It would not be easy—nothing ever is—but the Northmen would learn that Wessex will not bow. This is our home, and we will fight to reclaim it."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0020.a: "The resistence begins here."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0021.t: "Legend of Burnt Cake"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0021.desc: "The woods seemed endless, my limbs heavy with exhaustion and my body aching from the battle. Every step felt like it might be my last, but then, through the trees, I saw it—a small hut, humble and warm against the cold wilderness. I knocked, desperate for rest, and was greeted by a kind-faced woman who, seeing my bedraggled state, took pity on me. She did not recognize me as her king, but perhaps that was a mercy. To her, I was just another soldier of Wessex, weary and lost.\n\nShe offered me a seat by the fire, her words soft and motherly as she placed cakes in the embers to bake. "Watch these for me," she said, stepping outside to gather firewood, "and make sure they don’t burn." But the warmth of the hearth and the weight of my weariness were too much to resist. Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.\n\nThe sharp scent of burning jolted me awake just as she returned. Her face darkened, and she scolded me fiercely for my negligence. "Can’t even watch a few cakes!" she exclaimed, her words stinging yet oddly grounding. I stammered an apology, but as her frustration softened, I couldn’t help but smile faintly. Even in the depths of my trials, life’s small humilities endured."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0022.t: "A Call to Action"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0022.desc: "The damp air of the marshes clung to me, heavy with the weight of our retreat. For weeks, we had hidden like hunted prey, but no more. As I looked out over the quiet waters, the truth settled in my heart: if Wessex was to endure, we could not linger here in the shadows. Guthrum and his Northmen would not rest, and every moment we delayed only strengthened their grip. We had to strike, and strike decisively, or my kingdom would be lost to the tides of history.\n\nI turned to my followers, their faces worn but resolute. "The time has come," I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil within. "We will leave this refuge and rally the people of Wessex. Let them know their king still fights for them." I sent them out with orders to spread my message — a call for the swords of Wessex to gather at Egbert’s Stone, where we would make our stand. The risk was great, but so too was the reward. Wessex would rise, or it would fall, but it would not be forgotten."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0022.a: ""Onwards!""
 HEE_great_summer_army.0022.a.tt: "Having sent out messagers to rally your people, you must not leave the safety of the marshes to head towards Egbert’s Stone where you will soon discover if any in Wessex still have the strength to stand against the Northmen alongside you."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0023.t: "A Disheartening Discovery"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0023.desc: "The chill of the morning air bit at my face as we crested the hill and arrived at Egbert's Stone. My heart sank as my gaze fell upon the empty expanse below. No banners waved, no crowds gathered. Only the wind moved across the barren terrain, whispering a silence that cut deeper than any blade. I clenched my fists, my thoughts churning. Had my call gone unheard? Or worse, had the people of Wessex already abandoned hope in their king?\n\nI dismounted, my boots sinking into the soft earth as I stared at the lonely stone. The weight of the crown felt heavier than ever. Without the strength of my people, what hope was there to stand against the Northmen? Yet to give in to despair would mean abandoning Wessex to its fate. I clenched my fists, forcing my thoughts to steady. If no one came, then I would find another way. I would not let this be the end — not for my kingdom, not for my people, and not for me."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0023.a: "Have I truly been abandoned?"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0023.a.tt: "Having arrived at Egbert's Stone to find no army has gathered, you must now consider your next steps forward."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0024.t: "The Swords of Wessex"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0024.desc: "I stood atop Egbert’s Stone, lost in thought, the weight of uncertainty pressing heavily upon me. The wind whispered through the trees, carrying with it a strange, almost palpable tension. For a moment, I thought it was my mind playing tricks, the shadows shifting in the forest below. But then I saw it—a glint of steel, a movement among the trees. My breath caught as shapes began to emerge from the shadows, one by one, then in clusters.\n\nMen. Swords and shields gleaming in the fading light, their faces resolute and their steps unwavering. My heart surged with disbelief and joy as the realization struck — they had come. The call had not gone unheard. These were the swords of Wessex, my people, answering their king's summons. I raised my hand in greeting, unable to contain the swell of hope within me. The Northmen would not have their way; Wessex would not fall. Together, we would reclaim our lands, and the fight for our freedom would begin anew."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0024.a: "My call has been answered!"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0024.a.tt: "An army - your army - has gathered."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0025.t: "Revanchism"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0025.desc: "I stood at the heart of my army, the gathered warriors of Wessex forming an unbroken sea of shields and spears before me. Their faces were etched with resolve, their eyes fixed on me with anticipation. The weight of the moment pressed heavily upon my shoulders, but I let it fuel my purpose. I raised my sword high, its blade catching the light, and spoke with all the fire my soul could muster.\n\n"This is the hour! The hour when we take back what is ours, when we stand as one against the Northmen who seek to tear our land asunder! They may think us broken, but they will soon know our strength! We fight not just for Wessex, but for our families, our homes, and for the hope of a future free from fear!"\n\nA roar erupted from the men, a thunderous cry that echoed across the fields. Their voices became one with mine, their spirit unshakable. I tightened my grip on my sword. The final battle had come, and with it, the fate of Wessex—and perhaps England itself—would be decided."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0026.t: "The Path Forward"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0026.desc: "The din of battle has faded, replaced by the solemn quiet of victory. Before me stands Guthrum, the great scourge of Wessex, now humbled and bound. His gaze meets mine—proud still, but the weight of defeat is clear in his eyes. My men await my decision, their swords bloodied and their spirits high, yet I cannot afford to be ruled by vengeance. This moment demands wisdom, not fury.\n\nKilling him would be simple. His death would satisfy many and serve as a warning to those who dare challenge us. But I think beyond the battlefield. Would his death truly secure Wessex? No, I see a different path. Perhaps this Dane can be made an ally, his strength turned to serve peace instead of war. A baptized Guthrum could unify Saxon and Dane, ending years of bloodshed. The question lingers: will he bend the knee and accept Christ? I look at him once more, knowing this choice will shape the future of my kingdom and my dream of England."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0026.a: "A shared faith will unite us."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0026.b: "God shall be his judge."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0026.b.tt: "Guthrum and the Northmen have proven to be a deceitful and greedy people. Even if they were to accept baptism, who could say it was honest and true? Better to make an example of Guthrum's death and let God determine what shall become of Guthrum's eternal soul."

 HEE_great_summer_army.0027.t: "A New Beginning"
 HEE_great_summer_army.0027.desc: "The river flows gently under the morning light, its waters cool and clear. I stand at its edge, watching as Guthrum — now Æthelstan — kneels before the priest, his proud head bowed. The murmured prayers mingle with the sound of the stream, a holy moment unfolding before my eyes. One by one, his men follow, their bodies dipped into the water as if to wash away years of bloodshed and strife. The sight is striking, almost otherworldly, and for a moment, peace feels tangible.\n\nI glance at my court, their faces a mixture of relief and uncertainty. They share my hope, though we all know this peace may not last. The Danes will come again, and others too, drawn by the riches of our lands. But in this moment, as Guthrum rises from the water, his face calm and solemn, I feel a spark of something greater: faith. Whatever storms may come, Wessex will endure. Our people are strong, our cause righteous. With God’s grace, we shall be victorious. Always."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0027.a: "Amen."
 HEE_great_summer_army.0027.a.tt: "Historical Context: In 866, the Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia with the intention of conquering all of the English kingdoms. During its campaign, the Viking army conquered the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria. It initially overran the Kingdom of Wessex, but Danish King Guthrum was defeated by Alfred's army at the Battle of Edington in 878. Under the terms of his surrender, shortly afterward, Guthrum was obliged to be baptised to endorse the agreement, as well as to allow him to rule more legitimately over his Christian vassals but remaining pagan to his pagan vassals. He was then with his army to leave Wessex."
