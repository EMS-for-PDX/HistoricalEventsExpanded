 HEE_jeanne_darc.0004.desc:0 "My [jeanne_liege.GetLadyLord], there are strange tidings from the county of [home_of_jeanne_darc.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]. As our country suffers under the strain of war, a young woman has come forward and declared that the Lord has spoken to her and instructed her to deliver us from the enemies of our land. She wears armour, wields a sword and rides with the soldiers. Her name is [jeanne_the_maid.GetFullNameNoTooltip] and she is said to be approaching your court at this very moment to offer her services to you as a leader in the war.\n\nSurely, it's an absurd notion that a young peasant woman should take the role of marshal or general of the [jeanne_liege.GetTitleTierName]'s armies?"

 HEE_jeanne_darc.0005.desc:0 "My [jeanne_liege.GetTitleTierName], the lords of the Realm complain. They think it most unfitting and strange that a young maid of low birth is allowed such a prominent position when there are noble lords aplenty who are much more well prepared and competent to lead your armies. Some of them are asking if you are doing this deliberately to insult them.\n\nThere is also the issue of her claiming to be personally sent by God - it sounds rather heretical."

Still, my loyalty to you comes from Christ and He is stronger than the Devil who has corrupted your faith.

The things she says are considered heretical by some in the Holy Church, and others, frankly, see their positions threatened by one of such low birth and meager schooling gaining so much prestige.

Meanwhile, the clergy is divided, some seeing a heretic and others a saint."

Many of them refuse to accept that a lowborn woman from [home_of_jeanne_darc.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], however competent and pious, be continuously given so many privileges normally reserved for nobility. It sets a bad example for the peasants and may cause unrest, they fear. There have also been numerous incidents of perceived insults and scandals of protocol between [jeanne_the_maid.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and various prestigious army commanders.\n\nIt seems many nobles feel they have suffered her too long, and some still entertain the idea of demanding her arrest and trial for heresy."

She says she has seen her fate in a vision and that she knows what is to come.\nThe crowds surrounding the trial all await the verdict with tension.
