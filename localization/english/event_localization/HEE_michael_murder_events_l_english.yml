 #HEE Michael's Murder
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0001.t: "A Time to Relax"
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0001.desc: "After a hard day of dealing with the myriad of administrative duties I must attend to as Emperor, my good friend [basiliskianos.GetTitledFirstName] seems to notice my exhaustion. [basiliskianos.GetTitledFirstName] suggests that a night of good fun (and no small amount of drinking) could be a remedy for the work that consumes my daily life.\n\nWhile it is true a night out on the town would be quite enjoyable, there are still many duties left for me in the palace. A review from my Steward regarding the state of the Anatolian Theme requires review and an ambassador from the Kingdom of Italy arrived just yesterday seeking an audience.\n\nAlthough an evening out would provide a much needed reprieve from my duties, a small voice echoes in my mind - reminding me of work so far left unfinished..."
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0001.a: "Perhaps a night out will do me good."
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0001.b: "I have more important matters to attend to."

 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0002.t: "A Murderous Awakening"
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0002.desc: "A great pounding of your head is the first thing you feel as you awaken from your sleep. Almost immediately, a feeling of tiredness and thirst overcome you - but those sensations are quickly replaced with anxiety when you come to realize you hear a great commotion outside your chambers.\n\nNo sooner had you taken notice of the disturbance outside than you hear a man yell and your door bust open as men flood into your room. Some of their swords are coated with blood, [basiliskianos.GetTitledFirstName]'s blood you realize as you remember he had graciously offered to stand watch over your room as you slept.\n\nAt the head of the murderous group is a man you recognize even through your hangover - your Co-Emperor and supposed companion [basil.GetTitledFirstName]. As the group appraches you with swords raised, you know they have come for your life. With a brief moment to act, what should - can - you do?"
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0002.a: ""Basil please! Remember our friendship!""
 hee_basil_rise_michael_falls.0002.b: ""I will not go quietly!""
