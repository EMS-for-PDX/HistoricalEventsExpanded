 #Rise of Simeon
 HEE_rise_of_simeon.0001.t: "The Future of the Realm"
 HEE_rise_of_simeon.0001.desc: "After a hard day of dealing with the myriad of administrative duties I must attend to as ruler, my body as well as my mind feel tired. For some time the energy that used to fill me in my younger days has long since vanished. No doubt my councillors have already noticed, which would explain their attitude and my lighter workload over these past few weeks.\n\nPerhaps it is time to considering setting down and allowing the next generation to take their place. It is not as if I have anything to prove or fear my legacy is not established - I have lead campaigns against the Slavs and Croats, oversaw my nation's conversion to the Christian Church, and brought the unruly boyars to heel.\n\nThe only question that remains is if my sons are ready..."
 HEE_rise_of_simeon.0001.a: "My son Vladimir's time has come."
 HEE_rise_of_simeon.0001.b: "Simeon's time has come."
 HEE_rise_of_simeon.0001.c: "My time is not yet over!"
 boris_abdication_to_his_son: "You shall abdicated the throne and retire to a monastery while your son takes your place as ruler"
 boris_refuses_abdication_to_his_son: "You plan to continue to rule the realm no matter your state of mind or body"

HEE_rise_of_simeon.0002.t: "A Return to the Old Ways?"
HEE_rise_of_simeon.0002.desc: "For many years I have worshipped the gods of Old Bulgaria; the faith of our nomadic ancestors who worshipped the eternal blue sky and fertile earth mother. But it was my father who accepted the Christian God and took in their Roman missionaries who now pollute the realm. While my father treated this new faith as the future of Bulgaria, one in communion with those to our South and West, I see it for what it truly is - instruments of Byzantium that work solely to influence the Bulgarian kingdom.\n\nAs prince, I could do nothing to oppose my father openly - lest I be crushed like boyars before me - but as King, it is within my power to turn the realm back to our true faith... one untainted by foreign influence."
HEE_rise_of_simeon.0002.a: "We must return to the true faith!"
HEE_rise_of_simeon.0002.b: "Perhaps now is not time for upheaval..."
valdimir_pagan_restoration: "You will return to openly worshipping Paganism, and institute a widespread re-institution of the old faith. In this, the Christian temples will be torn down and the Christian clergymen will be driven out"
vladimir_decides_to_be_cautious: "Caution is a wise tool. The new Christian faith has developed strong roots in the realm, and it may be too damaging to uproot them now. While you will mantain your pagan faith in secret, you will endure the presence of Christianity - atleast for now..."

HEE_rise_of_simeon.0003.t: "The Sins of a Son"
HEE_rise_of_simeon.0003.desc: "*BOOM*\n\nThe doors to the throne room are thrown open as a number of armed men enter. Absorbed with matters of state, I am stunned by their sudden appearance to such a degree it takes a moment to recognize the man leading them to be my father. Still clad in the robes of a priest, yet with a sword at his side, the expression on my father's face betrays his intentions as anything but pleasant - if the sight of his armed compatriots did not.\n\n"What is the meaning of this father?"\n\nMy father's face harden when he hears me, "You have to ask? Your foolish attachment to the old ways threatens the realm. The destruction of the Christian temples and persecution of the clergymen goes too far, even for my son. You have proven yourself a fool, unable to see the way forward. Thus I must act to remove your rot before the whole realm is corrupted.""
HEE_rise_of_simeon.0003.a: "Fa-Fa-Father - No!"

HEE_rise_of_simeon.1000.t: "Simeon's Education"
HEE_rise_of_simeon.1000.desc: "Due to his status as my third son, Simeon has long been groomed to become a high-ranking cleric. Long has he studied in the monasteries and churches of the realm, but it has become clear that the centers of learning here in Bulgaria are unsuited for a mind like my son's. His teachers afford him nothing but praise, and extoll his intelligence and wisdom as yet unseen in a child. One of his teachers has even suggested that perhaps the boy be sent to the University of Constantinople where he could be instructed by the best teachers in the world.\n\nCertainly to send Simeon there would further his education, but outside of my realm, there is much I could not control..."
HEE_rise_of_simeon.1000.a: "Constantinople will nurture his mind"
simeon_sent_to_constantinople: "Simeon will be sent to Constantinople, where he will study under some of the best and brightest teachers in the known world"

HEE_rise_of_simeon.2000.t: "A Princely Reunion"
HEE_rise_of_simeon.2000.desc: ""I am home!" says a well-dressed newcomer to my court.\n\nIt takes but a moment to recognize the man as Simeon - not as the boy who left for Constantinople some years ago, but as a man. Energetic, confident, and with a glint of intelligence within his eyes, it would seem that his time in the Roman Capital has served him well. Having returned to Bulgaria, it is now a question of how best to utilize the newly returned prince."
HEE_rise_of_simeon.2000.a: "Welcome home!"
