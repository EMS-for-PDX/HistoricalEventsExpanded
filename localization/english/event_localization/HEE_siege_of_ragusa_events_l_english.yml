 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0001.t: "A Neverending Siege"
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0001.desc: "As I stand looking out at my city's battered ramparts, my heart grows heavy as I once more consider the ongoing siege. The past months have tested my peoples' resolve - and while we have continued to stand strong, I can see our once firm spirits bending under the weight of the crisis. The arab raiders, ruthless and unyielding, have already devastated our coastal neighbors, and I fear our defiance will only bring harsher retribution. Without outside aid, the inevitable breach looms, threatening our storied city with a fate worse than those that have fallen before.\n\nNow, in a rare moment of silence, I find myself pondering my options. It is a a bitter concession, but it becomes ever clearer to me that without allies Ragusa will fall. But the simple answer of allies brings complex questions: who possesses the resources, and the will, to aid us in this time of need."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0001.a: "The Romans may provide relief."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0001.b: "We will stand strong, alone!"
 reach_out_to_roman_emperor_for_aid: "The Romans are no friends of the Arab pirates, and may be willing to provide aid to ensure an Arab defeat at our walls. It may be well worth it to dispatch envoys to Constantinople to seek assistance."
 attempt_to_fend_off_aghlabids_without_aid: "Any day now these besiegers will grow weary and lift their siege. Surely it will just be a few more days - a week or so at most - before they give up on this protracted endeavor..."

 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0002.t: "A Plea for Aid"
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0002.desc: "Over the decades, weakened Imperial authority over the western Balkans has allowed the local Slavic tribes to throw off our suzerainty and re-assert their independence. However, this has opened the door to both Slavic and Saracen pirates in the Adriatic Sea, a consequence that is now bearing down on the city of Ragusa.\n\nFor months now, the people of Ragusa have managed to resist an Aghlabid siege and avoid the plundering of their city - a fate that has already befallen the cities of Budva, Risan, and Kotor. But now, with their strength declining, Ragusa has sent envoys to my court asking for aid in repelling the Muslim raiders.\n\nThey pledge to accept the Christian faith and once again acknowledge Imperial suzerainty, but while this is a god-given chance to strengthen our ties in the West, the question remains if I can spare the resources..."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0002.a: "We shall provide assistance."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0002.b: "I can not spare the men."
 relieve_the_siege: "You decide to send aid to the Zachlouboi in Ragusa, hoping this will lead to the re-establishment of Roman Authority in the Balkans and their conversion to the Orthodox faith."
 provide_no_aid: "Whatever your reasonings, you decide not to provide any aid to Ragusa, leaving their fate in their own hands."

 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.t: "The Question of Aid"
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.desc: "The question remains of what form my assistance will come in. My steward suggests a simple shipment of supplies will be sufficient, believing that the Muslim reavers will eventually abandon the siege when it becomes clear Ragusa will not give in nor be overcome. My marshal suggests the opposite - to deploy the Imperial Fleet to relieve Ragusa in a show of force that will not only deter any further raids in the region but also signal our intentions to bring the region back into the Roman fold.\n\nI could always compromise and send a small detachment of men alongside supplies to help relieve the siege. Then again, I have not formally pledged my aid. I could always go back on my word and refuse Ragusa any relief..."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.a: "These raiders will suffer the full might of my Fleet."
 send_roman_navy: "You will dispatch the Imperial Fleet to sail for Ragusa and push back the Muslim raiders."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.b: "Grain and swords are what Ragusa need."
 send_ragusa_a_shipment_of_supplies: "You send a shipment of food and weapons to help Ragusa continue to endure the siege."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.c: "Roman grain and soldiers will show our support."
 send_both_soldiers_and_supplies_to_ragusa: "You dispatch men alongside supplies to help relieve Ragusa of their siege."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0003.d: "I have changed my mind. Ragusa will have no aid."

 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0006.t: "The Path Forward"
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0006.desc: "The news of the Romans lifting the Siege of Ragusa has reached my ears, bringing with it a great deal of worry. For many years the Romans have shown little interest in the affairs of the Balkans - too troubled with the Bulgarians or issues in the East to involve themselves in our affairs. But this intervention in Ragusa signals a new, assertive foreign policy that Constantinople may take towards the West. This Roman victory, celebrated by many, casts a long shadow over our future, and I find myself pondering the path that lies ahead.\n\nIn these uncertain times, I wonder if it might be wise to formally acknowledge Roman suzerainty and embrace their faith. Such a gesture could win favor in Constantinople and thereby secure a measure of autonomy for our tribe. After all, Rome has long been content to allow us to remain largely autonomous - so long as we pay lip service. But with the cost being our ancient faith, and a degree of my people's pride, I wonder if such a submission is worth the price..."
 HEE_siege_of_ragusa.0006.a: "Nominal submission now ensures our future."
