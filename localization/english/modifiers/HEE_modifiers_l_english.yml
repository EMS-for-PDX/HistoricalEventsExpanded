 hee_867_viking_raids_in_france_modifier_desc: "The Frankish Empire was first attacked by Viking raiders in 799 CE, and throughout the 9th century, viking raids on the region of Francia (roughly modern-day France) increased in frequency - destabilizing the region and terrorizing the populace.\n\nDespite the resolute opposition offered by men such as Robert the Strong, vikings, allied to the Bretons in Brittany, continued to pillage with widespread success. Poitiers and Angoulême fell to the pirates during 862-864, with the raids even threatening Toulouse. In 865 Orleans was sacked and Poitiers ravaged again, while the vikings and the insurgent Bretons together plundered Le Mans; but the year closed with big victories for the Franks, and for one district at any rate, Aquitaine, the viking menace was ended. On the Seine, however, the year 865 was disastrous. A small viking fleet forced its way up the river; Paris suffered from a land raid and for the whole of twenty days the vikings plundered in and around St. Denis. At the beginning of 866 the pirates had got past Paris as far as Melun, eluding the Frankish troops who were pursuing them. Thereat King Charles weakened and gave in. Four thousand pounds of silver, together with large quantities of wine, was the price he paid the vikings to get rid of them."

The costs of campaigning for both sides, including paying for soldiers' and officers' salaries as well as other wartime expenses, was enormous. The cutting of the canals around al-Anbar contributed to a long term economic decline in the region while the numerous acts of plunder and forcing people from their fields disrupted the productivity of the Central Iraq, perhaps the Caliphate's richest province, which put additional financial strain on the state. Baghdad itself was devastated, with the eastern side of the city never fully recovering from the damage it incurred during the war."

 hee_865_mecca_raid_modifier: "Aftermath of the Alid Uprising"
 hee_865_mecca_raid_modifier_desc: "The uprising began in Mecca in April 865, when Isma'il ibn Yusuf, a Hasanid Alid, and his supporters forced the local Abbasid governor, Ja'far ibn al-Fadl ibn Isa ibn Musa, to flee the city. Isma'il then proceeded to plunder the city, even removing the valuable objects from the Ka'aba and emptying the treasury of money and valuables, as well as extorting 200,000 gold dinars from the inhabitants. After fifty days he left for Medina, but although the governor of the latter made no attempt to resist and went into hiding, Isma'il returned to Mecca and laid siege to it. As the siege dragged on, famine spread in Mecca, and many of its inhabitants died; after 57 days, the Alid left Mecca and made for Jeddah. There he repeated his exactions, confiscating wealth, merchandise, and food.\n\nIn January 866, on the Day of Arafah, he attacked the Hajj pilgrims and their accompanying Abbasid military escort, sent by Caliph al-Mu'tazz. After killing some 1100 pilgrims, the rest fled into Mecca, and did not dare exit the city, while Isma'il returned to Jeddah unmolested. Isma'il died in March/April 866 of smallpox, afterwhich his brother Muhammad succeeded him, but was pushed by Abbasid forces into the Yamama region in central Arabia."
