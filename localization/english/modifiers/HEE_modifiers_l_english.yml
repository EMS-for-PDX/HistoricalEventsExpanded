 alfred_annointed_by_the_pope_desc: "In 853, Alfred is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who "anointed him as king".

 alfred_lifelong_illness_desc: "Asser tells us in his Life of Alfred that after Alfred had married Ealhswith, he participated in a grand feast that had lasted for a day and a night he was struck without warning in the presence of the entire gathering by a sudden severe pain that was quite unknown to all physicians. And since that day he has been plagued continually with the savage attacks of some unknown disease, such that he does not have even a single hour of peace in which he does not either suffer from the disease itself or else, gloomily dreading it, is not driven almost to despair. But the fact he is not confined to his bed shows all that Alfred is strong in both will and faith."

 anarchy_at_samarra_financial_straits_desc: "The Caliphate is currently suffering from a shortage of revenue with which to pay the troops.

 1202_syria_earthquake_epicenter_modifier_desc: "In May 1202 a severe earthquake struck Palastine and southwestern Syria. While a magnitude of 7.6 has been estimated, there can be no doubt as to the severity of the damage inflicted by the event. English historian Ralph of Coggeshall (d.1228) reported that the cities of Acre and Tyre were “overthrown” while Arabic accounts write that the city of Bedegene was "swallowed up". Nablus, thought to have been near the epicenter of the quake, was almost entirely destroyed, while in Damascus, as in many other places, mosques collapsed, causing great terror amongst the population. There was heavy loss of life in Tripoli, where the old castle of Arqa was ruined. Arabic reports speak of over a million people having died, which are likely exaggerated, but should not detract from the fact this remains one of the most catastrophic quakes to hit the region in history."

 1202_syria_earthquake_tremor_modifier_desc: "The 1202 Syrian Earthquake must have felt like an apocalyptic event for those who experienced it. Striking at about dawn on 20 May 1202 with an epicenter in southwestern Syria, the earthquake is estimated to have killed around 30,000 people while heavily damaging cities and towns across the region - most notably Tyre, Acre and Nablus. And though the quake occured in Palastine, tremors were recorded from Sicily in the west to Azerbaijan in the east and from Constantinople in the north to Aswan in the south. It was these tremors that have shaken the earth, frighting the local populace who view them as a sign that troubled times may be approaching."

 hee_867_viking_raids_in_france_modifier: "Aftermath of Viking Raids"
 hee_867_viking_raids_in_france_modifier_desc: "The Frankish Empire was first attacked by Viking raiders in 799 CE, and throughout the 9th century, viking raids on the region of Francia (roughly modern-day France) increased in frequency - destabilizing the region and terrorizing the populace.\n\nDespite the resolute opposition offered by men such as Robert the Strong, vikings, allied to the Bretons in Brittany, continued to pillage with widespread success. Poitiers and Angoulême fell to the pirates during 862-864, with the raids even threatening Toulouse. In 865 Orleans was sacked and Poitiers ravaged again, while the vikings and the insurgent Bretons together plundered Le Mans; but the year closed with big victories for the Franks, and for one district at any rate, Aquitaine, the viking menace was ended. On the Seine, however, the year 865 was disastrous. A small viking fleet forced its way up the river; Paris suffered from a land raid and for the whole of twenty days the vikings plundered in and around St. Denis. At the beginning of 866 the pirates had got past Paris as far as Melun, eluding the Frankish troops who were pursuing them. Thereat King Charles weakened and gave in. Four thousand pounds of silver, together with large quantities of wine, was the price he paid the vikings to get rid of them."

 hee_867_fortified_capital_tephrike_modifier_desc: "In response to the renewed persecution throughout Asia Minor by the Eastern Roman Empire, many Paulicians, under their new leader Karbeas, fled across the border to the areas of Armenia under Arab control. Under the protection of Umar al-Aqta, the Emir of Melitene, the sect was permitted by the Arabs to establish an independent state centered around the newly built city of Tephrike. The Paulicians fortified it and used Tephrike as refuge and the capital of their state during the ninth century."

 hee_867_paulician_settlements_thrace_modifier_desc: "Following an expedition led by Michael's uncle and general, Petronas, against the Paulicians from the eastern frontier and the Arab borderlands in 856, the imperial government resettled them in Thrace, thus cutting them off from their coreligionists and populating another border region.

 hee_fifth_fitna_aftermath_modifier: "Aftermath of the Fifth Fitna"
 hee_fifth_fitna_aftermath_modifier_desc: "The Abbasid civil war, sometimes known as the Fifth Fitna, was (at least economically speaking) extremely destructive for the Caliphate. The costs of campaigning for both sides, including paying for soldiers' and officers' salaries as well as other wartime expenses, was enormous. The cutting of the canals around al-Anbar contributed to a long term economic decline in the region while the numerous acts of plunder and forcing people from their fields disrupted the productivity of the Central Iraq, perhaps the Caliphate's richest province, which put additional financial strain on the state. Baghdad itself was devastated, with the eastern side of the city never fully recovering from the damage it incurred during the war."

 hee_tondrakian_purge_modifier: "T'ondrakian Purge"
 hee_tondrakian_purge_modifier_desc: "In the early years of the Kaysite amirate, the T'ondrakian religious sect was active in the provinces of Apahunik' and Hark'.

 hee_865_mecca_raid_modifier: "Aftermath of the Alid Uprising"
 hee_865_mecca_raid_modifier_desc: "The uprising began in Mecca in April 865, when Isma'il ibn Yusuf, a Hasanid Alid, and his supporters forced the local Abbasid governor, Ja'far ibn al-Fadl ibn Isa ibn Musa, to flee the city. Isma'il then proceeded to plunder the city, even removing the valuable objects from the Ka'aba and emptying the treasury of money and valuables, as well as extorting 200,000 gold dinars from the inhabitants. After fifty days he left for Medina, but although the governor of the latter made no attempt to resist and went into hiding, Isma'il returned to Mecca and laid siege to it. As the siege dragged on, famine spread in Mecca, and many of its inhabitants died; after 57 days, the Alid left Mecca and made for Jeddah. There he repeated his exactions, confiscating wealth, merchandise, and food.\n\nIn January 866, on the Day of Arafah, he attacked the Hajj pilgrims and their accompanying Abbasid military escort, sent by Caliph al-Mu'tazz. After killing some 1100 pilgrims, the rest fled into Mecca, and did not dare exit the city, while Isma'il returned to Jeddah unmolested. Isma'il died in March/April 866 of smallpox, afterwhich his brother Muhammad succeeded him, but was pushed by Abbasid forces into the Yamama region in central Arabia."

 paulicians_levied_for_war_desc: "In response to the threats against their state, every able-bodied man has been conscripted to fight the enemies of their faith. Though this has greatly increased the amount of available fighting men, it has equally depleted their homes of essential workers and tradesmen."

 medieval_warm_period: "Medieval Warm Period"
 medieval_warm_period_desc: "The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was a time of warm climate from about 900 A.D. to 1300 A.D. when global temperatures experienced an unusual temperature rise. The available evidence suggests that at times, some regions experienced temperatures exceeding those recorded during the period between 1960 and 1990. Its effects were evident in Europe where grain crops flourished, alpine tree lines rose, many new cities arose, and the population more than doubled. The Vikings took advantage of the climatic amelioration to colonize Greenland, and wine grapes were grown as far north as England where growing grapes is now not feasible. The temperature increase was not universal, being predominantly recorded in Europe, and had varying effects across different regions of the world."

 little_ice_age: "Little Ice Age"
 little_ice_age_desc: "The Little Ice Age was a period of wide-spread cooling from around 1300 to around 1850 CE when average global temperatures dropped by as much as 2°C (3.6°F), particularly in Europe and North America. While that temperature decrease might not sound like much, for people who lived through it the change was intensely dramatic. The cooling happened in phases, with an initial drop beginning around 1300, and a sharper and more abrupt onset of cold starting in 1570 and lasting for about a hundred and ten years. Much colder winters ensued. Rivers and coastal seas froze, grinding trade and communications to a halt. Crops and livestock withered while downpours spoiled harvests, unleashing widespread hunger and hardship. The severity of this Ice Age varied over the centuries, but all resulted in a sharp deterioration in the overall quality of life for the people of the period."
