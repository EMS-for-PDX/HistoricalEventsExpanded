Poitiers and Angoulême fell to the pirates during 862-864, with the raids even threatening Toulouse. In 865 Orleans was sacked and Poitiers ravaged again, while the vikings and the insurgent Bretons together plundered Le Mans; but the year closed with big victories for the Franks, and for one district at any rate, Aquitaine, the viking menace was ended. On the Seine, however, the year 865 was disastrous. A small viking fleet forced its way up the river; Paris suffered from a land raid and for the whole of twenty days the vikings plundered in and around St. Denis. At the beginning of 866 the pirates had got past Paris as far as Melun, eluding the Frankish troops who were pursuing them. Thereat King Charles weakened and gave in. Four thousand pounds of silver, together with large quantities of wine, was the price he paid the vikings to get rid of them."
