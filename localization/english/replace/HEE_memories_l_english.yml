 tulun_mudabbir_shukayr_power_struggle_desc: "The effective separation of powers, in medieval Islam, was in provincial administration - between the three divisions of military affairs, finance, and communications. Its purpose was to maintain the ultimate control of the imperial government, and prevent the emergence of provincial autonomies. When Ibn Tuliin arrived in Fustat as Egypt's newly appointed governor, he found two officials appointed by and responsible to Baghdad - the financial intendant, Ibn al-Mudabbir, and the postmaster, Shukayr.
