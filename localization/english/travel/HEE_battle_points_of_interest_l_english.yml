 BattlePoIHistoricalNameAdrianople: "The Battle of Adrianople"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameAdrianople: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '70000' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '200287' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 9th of August, 378 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Adrianople on August 9, 378 CE ranks among the worst military defeats in all of Roman history. Its estimated losses of over 10,000 are comparable to Roman defeats at Cannae (216 BCE) and Carrhae (53 BCE). The battle pitted the Germanic Ostrogoths and Visigoths under the leadership of the Thervingian chieftain Fritigern (d. c. 380 CE) against the unpopular and glory-seeking Roman emperor Valens (r. 364-378 CE). The overwhelming victory for the Goths and the death of Emperor Valens are often considered the start of the events which led to the final decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the west. However, many historians agree that much of the blame for the tragic defeat was due to the poor leadership of Emperor Valens and not the ineptness of the Roman army. In his Roman History, 4th-century CE Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus said “The annals record no such massacre of a battle except the one at Cannae, although the Romans more than once, deceived by trickery due to an adverse breeze of fortune, yielded for a time to ill success in their wars ....” #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameCatalaunianPlains: "#emp Victor: Flavius Aetius [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '200287' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: Attila the Hun\nDate: 20th of June, 451 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains took place on June 20, 451 AD between a coalition, led by the Roman general Flavius Aetius and the Visigothic king Theodoric I, against the Huns and their vassals, commanded by their king, Attila. The fighting was brutal and chaotic, with tens of thousands killed on both sides including Theodoric I, but the battle ended with a hard-fought coalition victory. Attila withdrew his battered army from the battlefield, marking the first major defeat of his career.\nWhile modern historians debate the true significance of the battle, many agree it broke the myth of Hunnish invincibility and can be considered a triumph of Roman defensive strategy. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameBadr: "The Battle of Badr"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameBadr: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '33922' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: Amr ibn Hisham\nDate: 29th of May, 1176 AD#!\n#weak While only a few hundred people fought on each side, this battle, fought in western Arabia, was instrumental in the establishment of Islam. Two years earlier the Quraysh tribe had forced the Prophet Muhammad and his Muslim followers out of Mecca to the city of Medina. This would lead to a series of raids and attacks by the Muslims and their allies to disrupt trade into Mecca.\nThis low-level warfare culminated at the Battle of Badr. Muhammad had gathered 313 men to intercept a caravan carrying weapons for the Quraysh, but their plan was discovered and the Qurayshi leader Abu Jahl raised a force of 950 men to attack them. The two sides would begin a battle first with champions taking part in a three-on-three melee, followed by arrow attacks, and then a charge from the Muslim forces. The Qurayshi side then broke and fled, with Abu Jahl being killed during the rout.\nThe victory for the Muslims would ultimately lead to Muhammad returning to Mecca, and the religion of Islam spreading throughout the Arabian Peninsula. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameNahavand: "Battle of Nahavand"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameNahavand: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '163015' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '180637' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 642 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Nahāvand was a military clash in Iran between Arab and Sāsānian forces that was a major turning point in Iranian history. The battle ended in disastrous defeat for the Sāsānian armies, the near dissolution of the Sasanian Imperial army, and paved the way for the Arab conquest - which resulted in the Islamization of Iran.\nAt Nahāvand some 30,000 Arab troops, under the command of Nuʿmān, attacked a Sāsānian army alleged to number 150,000 men. The Sāsānian troops, commanded by Fīrūzan, were entrenched in a strong fortified position. After an indecisive skirmish, Nuʿmān pretended to be defeated and withdrew from the battlefield. Fīrūzan then abandoned his position and pursued his foe. The pursuit proved to be a major tactical error because the Sāsānians were forced to fight on unfavourable ground; the Sāsānian army, caught between two mountain defiles, was massacred by the Arabs. Both Nuʿmān and Fīrūzan died in the battle, and Iranian casualties were said to number 100,000.\nThe Battle of Nahavand, and the subsequent subjugation of Persia, have been hailed by some as among the most important and influential events in the history of Islam - comparable to the conquest of Greece by the Romans. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameGuadalete: "The Battle of Guadalete"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameGuadalete: "#emp Victor: Tariq ibn Ziyad\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '200251' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 19th of July, 711 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Guadalete was the first major battle of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, fought between the Visigoths under their king, Roderic, and the invading forces of the Umayyad Caliphate, composed mainly of Berbers and some Arabs under the commander Tariq ibn Ziyad. While many details about the Battle are muddled and unclear - from its' location, numbers, and even date - it is clear by the Battle's end the Christian army was routed and the Muslims were victorious. Supposedly, the engagement was a bloodbath: Visigothic losses were extremely high, including King Roderic along with many members of the Visigothic nobility, and the Muslims lost as many as 3,000 men, or a quarter of their force.\nThe Battle of Guadalete, and the subsequent capture of the Visigothic capital of Toledo, initiated the rapid decline of Christian Iberia. Within a decade all of the peninsula save the tiny Kingdom of Asturias and the mountain-dwelling Basques was under Muslims dominion. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameCovadonga: "The Battle of Covadonga"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameCovadonga: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '70000' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: Al Qama\nDate: Summer of 722 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Covadonga took place in 722 between the army of Pelagius the Visigoth and the army of the Umayyad Caliphate. Fought near Covadonga, in the Picos de Europa, it resulted in a victory for the Christian forces of Pelagius. It is traditionally regarded as the foundational event of the Kingdom of Asturias and thus the initial point of the Christian Reconquista of Spain after the Umayyad conquest of 711. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNamePliska: "The Battle of Pliska"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNamePliska: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '159123' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '70497' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 26th of July, 811 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Pliska (also known as the Battle of Vărbitsa Pass) was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I, and the First Bulgarian Empire, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vărbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine army, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased the skull of Nicephorus in silver, and used it as a cup for drinking.\nThe Battle of Pliska was one of the worst defeats in Byzantine history. It deterred Byzantine rulers from sending their troops north of the Balkans for more than 150 years afterwards, which increased the influence and spread of the Bulgarians to the west and south of the Balkan Peninsula, resulting in a great territorial enlargement of the First Bulgarian Empire. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameLalakaon: "The Battle of Lalakaon"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameLalakaon: "#emp Victor: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'Mamikonian0007' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '159724' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed] [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( 'paulician0002' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 3rd of September, 863 AD#!\n#weak In the Summer of 863 AD, having embarked on the traditional annual raiding expedition against the Byzantines, Umar al-Aqta was able to overcome the initial resistance against his invasion and reach the shores of the Black Sea where his forces sacked the port city of Amisos. When the Emperor Michael III learned of the fall of Amisos, he assembled a sizable force under his uncle Petronas, who managed to encircle the Arab army near the River Lalakaon. When the Emir realized the grave danger he was in, he rallied all his forces and attempted to break through the Byzantines lines and escape. This attempt failed, however, and the trapped Arab army was almost totally annihilated. Among the dead was Umar al-Aqta himself and possibly the leader of the Paulicians Karbeas - although his participation in the battle is uncertain.\nThe Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region and marked the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East. The importance of the victory did not go unnoticed at the time. The Byzantines hailed the victory as revenge for the Arab sack of Amorium 25 years earlier, the victorious generals were granted a triumphal entry into Constantinople, and special celebrations and services were held. #!"

 BattlePoIHistoricalNameLegnano: "The Battle of Legnano"
 BattlePoIHistoricalNameLegnano: "#emp Victor: Guido da Landriano, The Lombard League\nDefeated: [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID( '212501' ).GetFirstNameNicknamed]\nDate: 29th of May, 1176 AD#!\n#weak The Battle of Legnano was a battle between the imperial army of Frederick Barbarossa and the troops of the Lombard League on May 29, 1176, near the town of Legnano in present-day Lombardy, in Italy. The battle was crucial in the long war waged by the Holy Roman Empire in an attempt to assert its power over the city-states of Northern Italy, who in 1167 decided to set aside their mutual rivalries and join in a military alliance symbolically led by Pope Alexander III. The battle, in which the Emperor and his supporters were thoroughly routed, ended the fifth and final descent into Italy of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who after the defeat tried to resolve the Italian question by adopting a diplomatic approach. This resulted a few years later in the Peace of Constance (June 25, 1183), with which the Emperor recognized the Lombard League and made administrative, political, and judicial concessions to the municipalities - officially ending his attempt to dominate Northern Italy. #!"
